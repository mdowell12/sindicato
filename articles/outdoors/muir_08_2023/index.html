    <h1>Camp Muir</h1>
    <h2>August 10, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
    On a Wednesday afternoon, I stood at 10,000 feet on the southeast flank of Mount Rainier. Five companions and I started a two-day climb of the mountain earlier in the morning. We left the Paradise parking lot and marched for Camp Muir via the Muir Snowfield. Around 1:00 pm, the group's frontrunners crested the ridge at the camp's threshold. Now we rested there, waiting for the remaining members of the group to catch up.

    The camp bustled with activity. Sitting at the entrance, we saw day hikers in gym shorts and tiny backpacks post themselves on rocks for lunch. Groups of exhausted climbers began their descent from camp, ice axes and crampons protruding from their much larger backpacks. They were in the latter stages of a trying day that might have seen them wake up twelve hours earlier for a summit attempt. Then there were those who called this camp home for the day. They rested in front of the Gombu hut, a plywood, rectangular shack where clients of the guide companies bunked. Others shuffled between the camp's solar toilets and the Park Service's public shelter house, where more climbers bunked. Along with our group, other ascending climbers sidled in for some rest on their journey upwards.

    Camp Muir serves as the most popular base for the routes to Rainier's summit, and has done so for the last century. It saw its first use in 1888, when John Muir and his climbing party stopped here amid one of the mountain's first successful summit bids. The early climbers called it Cloud Camp until Muir's death, when it was renamed in his honor. In 1916, The Mountaineers (a local mountaineering organization) collaborated with the National Park Service to build a stone hut, the camp's first permanent structure. The hut stands today, along with the public shelter built in 1921, sheltering guides and climbers from the harsh surrounding environment. In recognition of these early collaborations between mountaineers and the park, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Besides minor advances in the technology behind gear and toilets, the place and the people occupying it haven't changed much since its founding.

    <p class="text">
    We walked down the other side of the ridge and onto the Cowlitz Glacier's late season snow, where overnighters pitch their tents in tight clusters. Camp Muir's permanent structures line the rock spine that divides the Cowlitz from the Muir Snowfield. This line effectively separates the day hikers from those attempting the summit, and permits are required to move onto the glacier. It's a convenient boundary for the park's administrative needs, but also prompts climbers to consider the added risk of the terrain they've entered. Pitched tents sit in the upper reaches of the Cowlitz cirque, a rim of cliffs that form a bowl-like cavern around the top of the glacier. The glacier begins a few hundred feet above camp and rolls down off the southeast side of the mountain. The cliffs are made of rotten volcanic rock, and camp residents quickly become used to their crackle and pop as they shed material through chutes onto the glacier below. Near the tents, on every side, are visible gashes in the glacier surface. These are the first on-route crevasses that climbers see, reminders of the hazard they will become more familiar with on the next day's ascent.

    <p class="text">
    And yet, a relaxed air pervades the camp in these early afternoon hours. We found a space in the mounds of snow that had been cleared for tents, just large enough for the three we would pitch. As we set up camp, we got to know the folks around us - neighbors for a night. Two men from Idaho and their companion from Oakland were pitched a few feet to our east. Tomorrow would be the Californian's third attempt at the summit, having been weathered out twice in the years before. With few other ways to kill the time while they rested, they sat on foam pads and watched us work. A dozen feet to the north was a large group of tents where more climbers gathered. They made a huddle, then broke, and a cloud of smoke emerged, floating through our site. We recognized the smell and laughed as one of their members, a bearded man in his forties, approached. He was one of the leaders of a nonprofit that aimed to help military veterans achieve mountaineering goals. He was in the middle of a 10-day stretch at Camp Muir, during which veterans were sent up from Paradise for him to guide to the summit. He'd escorted two groups to the top and planned to do it again the next day.

    <p class="text">
    Tents pitched, we melted snow for drinking water. A casual assembly line formed between the melters, who stuffed snow into stovetop pots, and the filterers, who sanitized the melted water. We sat in the snow, resting, chatting, hydrating, waiting for the hours to pass. We walked back onto the rock ridge to take in the southward views of Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood. Up here, we saw more day hikers coming and going from camp, a procession that continues through the daylight hours. Students of the guide companies practiced crevasse rescue down on the glacier. Roped together in a team of three, the rear climber simulated a fall into an imaginary crack, initiating the rushed process of pulling them out. The two others created hasty anchors in the snow, securing the fallen climber. Then they attached pulleys and knots to the rope, forming a haul system, and hoisted their companion out.

    <p class="text">
    5:00 pm was dinner time, and then it was time for bed. There were three hours of full daylight left, but the mood of the camp had changed. The Idahoans stood next to their tents, brushing their teeth. Everyone in the big veterans camp had already retired to their sleeping bags. In this place, where every evening dozens of people begin to nervously anticipate a predawn wakeup and the most significant mountain climb of their life, these are the quiet hours. But, unfortunately for the early sleepers, the camp never truly stops moving.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
    We crawled into our tents, pulled hats over our eyes, and got to work. Folks shifted as they searched for a comfortable sleeping position. Their inflated sleeping pads squeaked. Zippers whined when they left their tents, realizing they should have used the bathroom before going to bed. Footfall crunched in the snow around us. When all else was silent, a cough or a snore from a neighbor broke the peace.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
    After an hour, latecomers walked into camp and searched for a site. Seemingly unaware that each of the two dozen pitched tents housed hopeful sleepers, they spoke openly about the tradeoffs between two potential spots.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
    "How about down there in the gulley? It might be blocked by wind."
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
    "Well then we would have to walk uphill more every time we went to the bathroom."
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
    They chose some untouched snow nearby and began to flatten it into a sleeping platform. Their shovels plunged into the frozen surface in seemingly random intervals, making it impossible for the sleepers to background the noise and ignore it. With hours of daylight left, we thought about giving up. It would be much nicer to climb back up on the ridge and watch Mount Adams light up in the falling sun. But we had alarms set for 12:15 am and figured that every bit of rest might count for something. We remained in our tents.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
    After a while, sunshine left the sky and the line between sleep and wakefulness blurred. We caught a few winks. And then at 10:30 pm the night's first cell phone alarm rang out. Some neighbors planned an ultra early start for their climb. Awake again, we heard them exit their tents and prepare for the trip.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
    Thus began the next phase of a night at Camp Muir. Every half hour or so through sunrise, alarms would ring as a new group of climbers began their summit bid. When our own alarms finally rang, each of us was already awake, excited for what lie ahead. I pulled on my boots and opened my tent fly to a camp illuminated by headlamps, bouncing left and right as climbers searched in the dark for gear. Trios of headlamps moved away from us on the Cowlitz - rope teams starting up the route. Our group hurried down some breakfast and tied into our ropes. We checked our radios, confirmed our plans once more, and wished each other luck before marching out of camp.

    <p class="text">
    So it went for the many teams who left for the summit that Thursday morning. So it has gone a thousand times in the decades before. The sun would later rise on our group when we were three thousand feet above camp on the upper mountain. It rose, too, on camp, and the cycle continued. Guides and clients woke for breakfast and skill practice. Day hikers reached the end of their hike, took in the views, and went back down. And within a few hours, those pushing for the summit began to return from above. Our group made it back around 1:00 pm after a successful summit bid, twelve hours after we began the day and twenty four after we had first entered camp.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
    After a quick rest, we packed up, crested the ridge, and began the descent to our cars. Our site had been taken by a group who would go for the summit the next day - they claimed it before we had even vacated it. That was the wheel turning in this special alpine acre. For a century it has been a scene of human experience no less vivid than that of the famous summit that stands on its shoulders. Like a train station, it does not sleep. People come and go at any hour, passing through on their way to somewhere else. They are excited for what lies ahead, nervous for the unknown, in awe of the terrain that they will ascend through. On their way home, they relax and reminisce. They feel pride, pain, sorrow, strength. They share it all with neighbors, temporary in their proximity but etched forever into memory. They leave and the door revolves. They are replaced by the next wave, fresh for a test of their mettle in this magnificent environment.
