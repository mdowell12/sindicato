    <h1>Olympic Hot Springs</h1>
    <h2>April 9, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      On Easter Sunday in Subine, I took off with a friend for a day trip to Olympic National Park.
      We planned to meet others on the 7:10 a.m. ferry from Edmonds to Kingston, then drive to the Madison Falls parking lot outside of Port Angeles. Our ultimate destination was the Olympic Hot Springs, a collection of naturally occurring heated pools in the park.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      The pools sit near Boulder Creek, nestled in the forested mountains about a thousand feet above the Elwha River. In the recent past, it was possible to drive to a trailhead 2.5 miles from them, making them a quite accessible feature of the park. But in the last decade, the road between Madison Falls and the trailhead has been severely washed out. That leaves eight miles of additional travel on the remains of the road for those seeking the springs. Some choose to make the entire journey on foot, but we had bicycles racked on our cars and would pedal up the road, leaving only the last couple of miles for hiking.

      How was the weather? It was terrible. We knew it would be terrible, and that it would stay terrible. And we went anyway. Forecasts called for rain and a high of 50 degrees. Wisdom clearly indicated it was a day to stay inside. And yet, we were on a three hour trip to a broken road, where we'd bike for a couple wet hours, and follow it up with a sloppy walk through the snow that still covered the trail. Why? Well, the hot springs would be a welcome respite from the cold, made all the more satisfying by the challenge of getting to them. But, more simply, it was a weekend and it was raining everywhere in the state and we wanted to get outside, dammit. Adventure called!

      We made the Madison Falls parking lot around 10 a.m., Gore-Texed up, and began the bike ride. The road was lined with the deciduous trees draped in an almost neon moss that is typical of the Olympic lowlands. We followed the Elwha around a bend where the trees cleared and we took in the open valley before us. Mist rose from the trees in floating towers, obscuring snowy peaks high above. Before long, we met the washed out section of the road where the river flows through. We dismounted, walked our bikes into the trees, and followed a bypass trail around the washout. Then, back on the old road, we resumed our ride up the valley.

      There is much history on this route. These hot springs stand in contrast to the park's Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort, an hour's drive to the west. There, the park maintains a lodge and tiled pools that collect spring water. Bathers can soak in the pools in a controlled environment with food and drink available in the restaurant steps away. The Olympic Hot Springs are billed as a primitive version of this experience - simple rock pools filled with the spring water, surrounded by the natural environment. But this hasn't always been the case. In 1907, three men discovered the springs and built a cabin and bathhouse near them. Over time, the area grew into a resort that operated until 1966. The trail they cut through the forest is the same we would use to reach the springs, and is the only relic of the resort era that we encountered.

      A couple of miles into our ride, we reached another historical touch point. The road here climbed through a switchback, then turned toward a vast opening in the landscape. This was the basin of the former Lake Mills, which submerged the area until a decade ago when the Glines Canyon Dam was removed. The Glines Canyon Dam was constructed in 1927, where we now stood, at a chokepoint on the Elwha. We got off our bikes and walked onto the remaining dam structure, where the national park has put up educational signage. This dam, along with the Elwha Dam, blocked the river for close to ninety years, drastically altering the river's ecosystem. Evidence of this was still clear to us as we looked from the dam out over the valley. While vegetation has begun to reclaim the former floor of the lake, fields of silt dominate the landscape.

      We saw the sites, we took photos, and then we climbed back aboard our cycles. The road began ascending in earnest now. In low gear, we did not exceed a walker's pace by much. The rain turned from a light mist to a heavier drizzle. We were wet, but as our hearts thumped and we drew fresh mountain air into our lungs, we were still warm. As we climbed, deciduous trees gave way to pine. We moved up the north side of the valley, one thousand feet above the former lake, and finally made a right turn into the Boulder Creek drainage.

      Another two miles and we were at the end of the road. There was a trailhead here, where hikers began the short trek to the springs in the time before the road washed out. We stowed our bikes under the trailhead's bulletin board, then began walking - the second leg of our little triathlon. Of course, throughout the day we'd looked forward to the third leg - the swim in the hot springs. But this final 2.5 mile walk hammered that desire home. This was a true slog and we wanted it to be over. Without the road's strenuous uphill, we began to slowly cool. A mile into the trail, we hit snow, packed solid but with a slushy, slippery layer on top. We slipped and waddled, plowed through puddles. In one section, running water drained down the center of the trail, making an ankle-deep slush stream that we had no choice but to walk through. Later we crossed creeks, trying to keep our feet out of the heavy flow, but we understood that it didn't matter at that point if we slipped in.

      And yet, not one of us complained. Such is the grace of a light at the end of the tunnel. We pushed on for the hot springs, for warmth, for beer, for the decadent lunch we carried in our packs. We passed through the heavily eroded trail in the Crystal Creek ravine, over the creek, around the mountainside to Boulder Creek and finally across it, thirty feet above the water on an audacious log bridge still present from the area's more occupied past. We had arrived at the springs, triumphant.

    <p class="text">
      There were a handful of pools along the trail, ringed by boulders that people had set up to trap the hot water. Each pool had a border of deep emerald color, then muddy brown water in the center. We smelled the rotten egg sulfur familiar to any hot spring visitor, and it was welcoming. As we passed each pool, we dipped our cold hands, testing the warmth. They were warm. We rejoiced. Newly energized, we hurried between the pools, debating which was warmest, which had the best view, and which would ultimately be ours. We settled on a large pool off the high side of the trail, nestled under a tree. We set down packs, stripped to our skivvies, and settled into the water.

    <p class="text">
      "How is it?", someone asked.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
    	"It's warm! Oh my god it's warm."

    <p class="text">
      Yes it was. Though it wasn't quite deep enough. We laid back, sitting low, trying to submerge as much of ourselves as possible in the foot and a half of water. Each of us squirmed and shimmied, trying to find a deeper resting spot. Occasionally, a pocket of cold water would pass through, and our minds would flirt with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      But we laughed. This was crazy! We had come so far! It was time to enjoy the fruits of our labor. Though, in our haste to get in the springs, we left our packs and our food out of reach. It became clear that nobody was keen to leave the warmth of the water and grab them - the first admission that these springs were not quite paradise.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      No decadent lunch, then. Beers? Maybe not. Might not be safe with such a long trip back to the car, colder and wetter than we had imagined when we packed in home's warm confines. Ah, safety? The topic was now broached. Maybe this would not be a long stay in the springs, someone suggested. People were shivering. How much warm water would you need on the lower half of your body to keep the rest of you, sitting out in fifty degree rain, warm enough for comfort? More than this! Someone floated the idea of retreat and the house of cards fell. We made plans for a swift exit.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Shivering and already losing dexterity, we charged out of the water for our soaked clothes. I stood in the mud next to my pack, body exposed to the incessant rain, and was so cold that my jaw clenched. But, in such a time, there is no sense in complaining, or really even worrying. Action is all that counts. One by one, I peeled my soaked pieces of clothes off the pile and got dressed, warming up along the way.

    <p class="text">
      We wasted no time leaving the springs, scarfing down lunch on the move. We crossed the log bridges and made our way back through the snow. Soon, we were warm enough to laugh about the ordeal. After an hour of walking, we were out of the snow and close to the trailhead. We talked about things other than the cold. Just like that, the suffering we so recently endured was already a memory. We were ripe for more suffering.

    <p class="text">
      We got up on the bikes and prepared for the descent into the valley. For this leg, we wouldn't have the benefit of uphill travel to work and warm our bodies. It was clear that it would be cold, and we told ourselves that we would not stop to take in the views. We kicked off the nine mile return trip.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      I quickly noticed that, in all the wetness, it took me twenty feet to stop myself. This was a steep and unmaintained mountain road. Branches and rocks littered the pavement and the ground dropped swiftly off the downhill side. I was soaked to the bone, had a full backpack on, and was not confident in my braking ability, so I had to fight gravity and keep my speed low. I had a death grip on my brakes as we weaved down the road. After a mile, my hands ached. As my partners let go to shake out their hands, I knew they felt the pain, too. My hands throbbed and I was desperate to let go of the brakes, but was unsure I could control the bike without them engaged. There was nothing to do but plow through this latest obstacle, more pain to color the story we'd tell later.

      In half an hour, we dropped back into the Lake Mills basin, past the deconstructed dam, and down to the wash out. We got off our bikes, moaning and groaning, legs numb, hands sore. For all the day's hardship, this had been the worst portion. We had a mile of hiking and another brief bike ride before reaching the car. After taking a moment to gripe, we hauled our bikes into the woods to bypass the washout.

    <p class="text">
      The trail was muddy. It had been at the beginning of the day, too. Back then, we picked our way around puddles, lifting our bikes around them, keeping our feet clean and dry. But now we went straight through all but the worst of it. We were close to home, to a change of clothes and heat, and we would not be slowed down. Our feet couldn't get wetter, anyway. Fifteen minutes later, finally, we returned to the cars, victorious.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      I put my bike on the rack, got out of the rain and into Subine's back seat. I started tossing wet gear into the trunk. Stripped down and toweled off, I put on the dry set of clothes I'd left in the car for this moment. Then I crawled into the driver's seat and dove into the snack bag.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      It's remarkable, every time, how quickly we transition from wilderness back to civilization. I wouldn't have gone back out in the rain for anything. Sure, I recognized I'd been marching through the woods less than an hour ago, impervious to the mud because I was a creature of it. But, warm and dry in the front of Subine, munching on crackers, it was hard to feel like that was the same me.

    <p class="text">
      Refueled and relaxed, we drove two hours around the peninsula back to the Bainbridge ferry. As we sailed across Elliott Bay, we watched the Seattle skyline and home grow closer. It was a fitting conclusion to the long day: a flirtation with the wild, a brush with danger, and an embrace of discomfort.
