    <h1>Ruth and Icy Traverse</h1>
    <h2>August 26, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      On a Friday evening in late August, I set out in Subine for Hannegan Trailhead, far north in the Cascades. Three friends joined me on an attempt at the Ruth and Icy Traverse, a route linking Ruth Mountain and Icy Peak. The mountains are both 7,000 ft. tall, capped with glaciers, and sit just inside North Cascades National Park, where they are a separated by a mile-long picturesque ridge. They are known for the approachable routes across their glaciers where climbers find mellow slopes and straightforward lines to the summits.

    <p class="text">
      But this was late August after a winter with below-average snowfall, and the glaciers were no longer so toothless. Recent trip reports warned that there was little snow left covering their crevasses. Whatever snow remained would be crucial to our success, allowing us to cross gaps in the ice that were too wide to step over. In the August heat, though, the snow promised to be soft, further compromising its ability to hold our weight. We knew it would be difficult to find safe passage through the glaciers in these conditions.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      And so we arrived at the trailhead aware of our imperfect odds for success. Something about this felt unfamiliar. It wasn't the scene or the summits that were different. We had each spent a dozen nights at trailheads this summer, ready to rise before the sun to tackle a mountain. Between us this year, we had summited each of Washington's volcanoes, including a trip up Mount Rainier together a month prior. In comparison, Ruth and Icy were far less hallowed in the conversations of our peers. But as we climbed those other well-trodden peaks, and so many like them, we were accompanied by a score of other people. The way up those mountains was crystal clear, often laid out in explicit steps by predecessors, published on the internet in loads of places, easily researched and memorized before leaving the house. Success was never guaranteed, but it often felt like, if you could get your body to follow the steps, you would end up on the summit.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Not so on this trip. In the morning, we would hike up to the foot of the glacier and confront a big unknown. There, a three hour drive, a night in our cars, and a six mile walk invested, we would search for a route through the hazards. If we found nothing, we were prepared to turn around, no summits in the bag. Here was a necessary ingredient in the recipe for real adventure: a stark possibility that it might not work out. We would set out in the morning with the gear, the resourcefulness, the experience we had accumulated on trips past. With our judgment, perseverance, and a touch of risk tolerance, we would face the glacier and perhaps butt up against the limits of our abilities. It was a pinnacle opportunity for us in a beautiful alpine setting.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      We left the parking lot as the sun rose, then set out on a trail along Ruth Creek. As  we ascended through pine forest and lowland brush, the cliffs above us lit up in alpenglow. Two miles in, the valley bent southeast and we got our first view of Ruth. It seemed far away. The air in the valley was humid and the incline, while mellow, did not cease. Steady work brought us to the four mile mark, near the valley head. We pushed up to Hannegan Pass. Here, at 5,100 ft., we had completed about half of the vertical gain to the top of Ruth.

    <p class="text">
      Smoke from recent wildfires hung in the valley of the Chilliwack River, now visible to us on the other side of the pass. The smoke silhouetted the many ridges diving into the valley floor. Water running down these mountainsides would gather in a river system that flowed in a giant counterclockwise hook, east and then north into Canada before emptying into the ocean near Vancouver. Yet, water caught behind us would travel back down to Ruth Creek, into the Nooksack, and straight west toward Bellingham and the Sound. Trails, too, spread out from this pass like spider legs, taking people in many directions.

    <p class="text">
      After catching our breath, we took the trail heading south. We climbed a gnarly dirt gully filled with blueberries, eating them as we fought upwards, sweetening the bitter effort. And then we were above the trees in the alpine. The trail wove around the backside of a knoll and onto the Ruth Arm, where we stared at the long path up the mountain. From this point, we could clearly see the glacier, pockmarked with crevasses.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      Within the hour, we had scrambled as high as the rock would take us. We were six miles in and now faced one of the tests we had lugged all the way out here for. We pulled out the rope. Chatter died down as we slipped on our harnesses. We scanned for a route. To our right, the glacier was striped with long, parallel crevasses, completely devoid of snow, too wide to step over and too long to skirt around. To our left was a plate of ice that rolled with increasing steepness over the mountainside and into oblivion. The ice was smooth, reflecting the sun like a sheet of metal. It looked too hard to accept crampons or axes. If one person lost footing on this surface, they would not be able to arrest their fall. They might pull the entire rope team down the slope with them. Too risky. And so, half a dozen miles and a few hours into this trip, only a few hundred vertical feet from the summit, we wondered if we should turn back.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      But, to our benefit, a finger of unmelted snow packed a crease in the ice above us. It looked to be the perfect ramp to get us up and over the initial hump on the glacier. We couldn't see what we would meet up there. We didn't even know if the snow on the finger was strong enough to get us that far. But this was it! A weakness in the natural facade that, with our ingenuity, might grant passage to the top of the mountain. Perhaps we would take a step on the snow ramp and punch through. Or maybe we would climb to the top of it and the next obstacle would force us to turn around. These were acceptable outcomes on a real adventure such as this. We would continue until the moment we felt unsafe, assessing each new risk as it revealed itself. With that, the first on our rope team stepped off the trail, onto the snow, and into the unknown.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      He prodded the snow with his ax, kicked a step, and judged it firm enough. Then he continued up the ramp between the sheets of shining ice, kicking steps and testing as he climbed. Thirty feet up, the rope became taught on our second team member and he began to climb, too. Soon we were all four ascending the finger, a caterpillar threading upwards through the field of ice toward the top of Ruth.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      As we climbed to the top of the finger and over the hump, we surveyed the flat saddle ahead. There were exposed crevasses here, but the flatter terrain made it less risky to navigate through them. We saw a field of safe snow in the shade under a large rock outcropping, a good checkpoint that we were comfortable heading for.
    </p>
    <figure class="article-img">
      <img class="article-img" src="./img/on_the_glacier_over_the_hump-resized.JPG"/>
    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      We hopped across foot-wide cracks that often widened into deep pits closeby. Our rope lead would cross a gap, then walk gingerly along the aisle between it and the next one, aiming for the narrowest crossings. We followed in a path that soon snaked through the crevasse field.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Where snow bridges remained, we used them to cross. With our weaving path, we were able to see lengthwise down the crevasses, and could often visually gauge the depth of the bridges. If they were a few feet thick, we felt they would hold us. But each first step on a bridge, over the void, was an exercise in faith. We would make a step, hoping the snow would hold, yet powerless if it did not. The rest of the team would brace, axes ready to arrest a fall if it happened. But the bridges held, and our team made its way through.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      Safe on the snow field, we rounded the rock outcropping and approached the last challenge before the summit. The glacier rolled over a knoll here, making a large breaking wave that swept down the mountainside. These crevasses were much larger, and we could see into them from the side of the wave. They opened wide, chunks of broken ice protruding from their depths like menacing teeth. Strips of snow bridged the gaps, thin roofs over dark caverns with no visible bottom. Between two fissures, we found a narrow ramp onto the knoll. Carefully, we ascended the ramp and dispatched the remaining glacier. Then, after a small scramble up a rocky ridge, we stood on top of Ruth Mountain.

    <p class="text">
      We were giddy, having solved the problems on Ruth glacier, securing one of our goals for the day. We enjoyed panoramic views of the Cascades. To our north were Tomyhoi and American Border Peak, a stone's throw from Canada. East were the Chilliwacks and Mount Spickard. Then the foreboding Picket Range, with Fury, Terror, and Challenger piercing the sky. Most incredibly, just across the valley to our southwest, was Mount Shuksan. Glaciers hung like curtains in its vertical gullies. Snow and ice hid in the upper reaches of the scoured Nooksack Cirque, melting into ribbons of water that hurried down the slopes, collecting in waterfalls on a thousand foot journey to the valley below. We took a moment to enjoy our front row seats for this awesome natural scene.

    <p class="text">
      But the day's work was far from finished. To the south, a mile away along a crumbling ridge remained Icy Peak. It looked so far away. The ridge dropped 1,300 ft. to a saddle between the peaks before regaining that elevation. We could see the glacier on Icy's northwest flank, crevasses visible from all the way back here. The mountain was capped with four rock towers that seemed unclimbable. It was all quite daunting on a day that had already seen us through a few trials. But, true to the spirit of the trip, further success uncertain, we would keep going until we were forced back. We stashed our camping gear on the summit, planning to attempt Icy and then return to Ruth for the night. We ate a quick lunch, grumbled a bit, then got to it.

    <p class="text">
      Down a knife edge ridge to a talus field, across a patch of snow, and down again through a heathered slope, we dropped to the saddle. Through the descent, we eyed Icy's glacier. A snow field meandered from the top, down the slope in the center of the ice, almost connecting to our traversing ridge. If we could just get on that, it might be a viable path through the crevasses.

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      We pushed on through fields of chunky, loose rock, having dispatched most of the 1,300 ft. descent to the saddle in under an hour. The late August heat wore on us. It was hard work, made harder knowing that no matter what was in the cards for Icy, we would have to reverse this trek and re-summit Ruth before making it to our tents for the night.

    </figure>

    <p class="text">
      When we finally made the base of Icy, we were knackered, and we were dried out. We stopped at the bottom of a small gully next to the glacier. Meltwater funneled into the gully and spouted from under the ice. Where it coursed down the rock and off the mountain, we gathered it and drank it, bringing some life back into our parched bodies.

    <p class="text">
      We began to consider the route up. The snowfield we'd seen from Ruth looked just as inviting from here - a wide highway through the center of the glacier. But, as we'd guessed, we would have to cross crevasses to get on it. We considered another route hugging the glacier's left side, but it seemed short on snow and heavy on impermeable ice. It would be the snowfield for us. We roped up and took to the glacier, headed once more for a network of crevasses.

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      It was tedious travel between the cracks, and my mind wandered. I began to think of my own smallness. Glaciers often inspire such thinking. They are, of course, mega environments on the macro scale. They cover square miles of land in ice that is always there, but somehow seems individual from the mountain it sits upon. On the micro, to a person standing on them, glaciers are monstrous. They drop away or loom above. They fracture, crash, stack up. A person on a glacier is like a swimmer floating in the open ocean. They are a pin prick on the surface of something vast, unaware of what dangers or wonders lurk below them. Solid ice, a thousand feet deep? Or a lifeless chasm, frigid and dark?
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Though made of the most rigid, impenetrable material, to our eyes frozen in both time and in space, they are in fact quite alive. On the scale of decades, they are more like cookie dough packed into a mountainside. As their own incomprehensible weight pulls them downward, they stretch and ooze through paths of least resistance. With the underlying terrain, they rise, turn, and dive. Where the direction or steepness of their path changes, they wrinkle, split, shear. Their crevasses, so hazardous to climbers, are often so orderly in their parallel rows. What incredible weight the glaciers must bear to turn this ice, this solid of solids, into the viscous masses that carve mountains!
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Before long, we'd made it through the crevasse field and stepped onto the snowfield's flat bottom. We began ascending the middle of the glacier. As we climbed, we zigged wide to the right of one big crack, then left around another. Icy's east ridge and summit block loomed above us. Our slope increased and the land bent around us, creating the feeling that we were walking through an empty amphitheater. We were quite alone out here, not having seen other people since the summit of Ruth.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      We came upon one last crevasse that spanned the glacier. No snow bridge in sight, we found a narrow choke point in the crack. It was only six inches wide, yet required a perilous step across the gap and up the slope. When I crossed, I looked down into a lightless void. The crack was framed by two ice walls, perfectly sheer, perfectly vertical. They were a hundred feet deep or more, poised together like a vice. Fifty yards to our right, the fissure opened violently, the walls curling back and then over themselves, framing bottomless caverns in a frozen dance. We climbed on, traversing above the wide opening, then off the glacier.
    </p>
    <figure class="article-img">

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      We were two hundred vertical feet from the top of Icy. Being honest with ourselves, we were surprised to have made it this far. Ruth's summit had seemed impossibly distant when we first saw it from the valley floor. We had successfully navigated its glacier, pushing through stress, fear, and physical exertion. Icy, then, looked far away, but we had made it here, too. We had climbed a vertical mile under the baking August sun. So far from the trailhead, far from home, far from other people, we felt like we were on the edge of the map. There was one more question mark ahead of us, and exhausted, unsure, we took off for it. We climbed on loose rocks and cramping legs toward the final gully, then scrambled up to the summit of Icy.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
       We sat together atop a rock tower, enjoying an afternoon snack, looking out on the mountains. We would soon rappel down the gully, re-enter Icy's cracked glacier, retread the countless rocks across the ridge, and climb back up Ruth. But these were no longer new obstacles for us. They were known quantities and we were certain of a path through them. And so, the tasks ahead lacked an edge held by the tasks completed. The adventure had reached its apex, and we could now allow ourselves to relax.

   <p class="text">
       We moved through the hazards and back to camp, still with great care, still with effort, but with a new lightness. We enjoyed a marvelous sunset as we ate dinner. We slept on the mountaintop under unobstructed stars. Across the valley, the ice cliffs on Shuksan broke and roared. We were safe, though, having had our struggle already. We had touched the sharp edge and we came back stronger for it.
