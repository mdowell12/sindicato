    <h1>Hex Mountain</h1>
    <h2>January 21, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      An early departure from Seattle, yesterday. Our destination was Hex Mountain off of Cle Elum Lake, east of Snoqualmie Pass.
      It was to be my first winter outing in the Teanaways, a region of Washington I've grown to love for its sparse vegetation and solitude.
      As we drove through Snoqualmie pass in the early morning hours, the sun peeked over the horizon. Wispy clouds hovered a couple
      hundred feet over the highway hiding parts of the I90 corridor's tree-covered ridgeline overhead.
      Daylight came as we crested the pass and descended to Cle Elum, where pillowy snow covered the land.
      Dusted pine trees spread in a pristine field of white before us. It was to be a bluebird day, the clear sky a salve
      after so much dreary weather west of the pass.

      Who could be so lucky as we were, meandering up the trail to Hex in a winter paradise? Four inches of powder snow sat above a firm
      pack that supported our footsteps. Our deprived skin wanted to chug the sunshine.

      We gained a few hundred feet of elevation after an hour of walking. As we rounded a turn and emerged from some trees,
      we caught our first view of Cle Elum Lake below us, a long finger in a valley between thousand foot slopes.
      Today the water was a deep blue and the sun reflected off its surface ripples.
      As we took in the view and eventually continued forward, the spirit of bonhomie set in. Our plodding congo line broke
      into pockets of conversation. Small groups shifted, making room for folks joining the chatter in front of them
      or leaving for those behind them. When hiking logistics, like removing a jacket, necessitated changes in our line's order,
      so came new conversations. Excited to be in such a fulfilling environment, our hearts opened and we tried to learn about each other.

      We gained the ridge that would lead to Hex's summit. The trail narrowed here. The steeper terrain exposed the season's snowpack to the wind, creating
      magnificent structures. To the lee side of the ridge, we saw a curving line of cornices, perilous shelves overhanging
      the gully below. Fallen trees snagged drifts that piled ten feet tall. Where the wind was unblocked, patches of ground
      held only a shallow crust of icy snow. As we climbed on through the woods, we watched the wind's brush strokes alter
      the ground around us.

      Three and a half hours in, our steady march put us on top of Hex. Under the blue sky, marvelous views opened to every side.
      Cle Elum Lake sat to the southwest, more of its length visible from our new vantage point. To the north was Mount Stuart and
      the Enchantments, granite jewels that crown any view on a clear day in the Teanaways. Stuart's bulk was capped with a cloud,
      but each edge and spire of the Enchantments was exposed for our admiration. They, with the smaller peaks filling the foreground,
      were a rising ocean wave. The minor peaks made the gathering base, broad and quiet. The Enchantments were the sharp crest,
      dangerous and alive, ready to curl and crash over us.

    <p class="text">
      As we ate lunch on the barren summit, the sun fell behind the clouds and a breeze picked up. We threw on every jacket we had,
      donned heavy gloves and snuggled under hoods. We were determined to endure a few moments more in this alpine bliss. But one by one,
      we filtered down from the peak and back into the shelter of trees. A group once more, we began the descent through fields of soft snow.
