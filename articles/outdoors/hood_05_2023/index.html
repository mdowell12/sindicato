    <h1>Mount Hood</h1>
    <h2>May 11, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      On a Wednesday afternoon, I left Seattle in Subine with a friend. We set out for
      Oregon, the Timberline Lodge parking lot, and the trail for Mount Hood.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Hood, the pointed pinnacle of Portland, is a particularly aesthetic volcano in the Ring of Fire. At 11,240 feet tall, it is the highest point in Oregon. Among mountain climbers, it is known for its accessible approach - a drive to the Timberline parking lot gets you on the mountain at 6,000 feet. But the summit is guarded by the mountain's crater, pockmarked with volcanic activity and rimmed by steep cliffs, inspiring reverence among those who would climb it. Still, a staggering 10,000 people attempt the mountain every year. Just under 150 of them have died in the last century.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      As far as serious mountains go, these are not bad odds. But the mind does tend to linger on those 150 and the mortal possibilities. Besides, it is the job of the mountaineer to identify risk, then decide whether, on a given day, the risks are worthwhile. What are the risks on Hood?
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Per usual, gravity is behind most of them. Up in the crater, in an area known as Devil's Kitchen, a poorly timed fall might send a climber into the mountain's fumaroles. These volcanic pits sit like Venus fly traps, waiting for food to land in an unlucky spot. They melt snow, spit steam, and taint the air with toxic, foul smelling gas. Few fall into them, but those who do do not make it out.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Others have fallen into crevasses on the mountain's glaciers. Of particular concern is the Coalman Glacier's bergschrund, which intersects a common route up the mountain. This crack in the glacial ice is a hundred feet deep in places. It spans the few hundred horizontal feet under the Pearly Gates, the iconic passge through the crater rim cliffs. Early in the year, it is covered in snow stable enough to walk across. As the year goes on, the snow thins, and this treacherous crack sits ready to swallow any who fall off the mountain above it.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Those who avoid these terrain traps might find other ways gravity can thwart them. When temperatures warm, ice caked on the mountain's cliffs loosens and falls. Large rocks do the same. They are funneled down the same chutes that climbers use to get up. Those climbers might be struck by the falling mountain, or they might simply fall themselves. Should they avoid the aforementioned hazards on the way down, they might not stop for a thousand feet.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      And then there is hypothermia, which has claimed a number of Hood climbers - a surprising portion of them in the summer months, when temperatures in Portland exceed 80 degrees. This is especially puzzling when you stand in the Timberline parking lot and look up at the mountain. You can see the entire route, a straight shot on wide open snow fields, past the ski resort, up into the crater and over its northern headwall. But any mountain jutting up, alone, into the jet stream like this one attracts weather quickly and sometimes without warning. It is not uncommon for winds to eclipse 100mph on the summit. Snow storms visit almost year around. Clouds form on a clear day, obscuring the climber's ability to navigate by sight. Each such hazard amplifies other hazards, and climbers who avoid the dangers of gravity may simply find themselves trapped up high through a cold night they are unprepared for.

    <p class="text">
      These were our mind's pacing bogeymen when we hit the trail at 4 a.m. the next day. It was a relatively late start for Hood, where climbers commonly leave the parking lot at midnight. We expected temperatures on the summit to stay around 25 degrees all day, mitigating the heightened rock fall risk that normally follows a morning thaw, and allowing us a few more hours of sleep.
      Under the stars, we plodded up solid snow on the mountain's south side. The sun already hinted at dawn. As we gained a methodical thousand vertical feet per hour, daylight and blue skies joined in. The vast Oregonian landscape unfolded behind us. There was Mount Jefferson, the next volcano in the ring, looking quite precipitous. Beyond it were The Sisters near the town of Bend. We passed the top of the ski lift and, around 8:30 a.m., pushed over the last incline before the crater and Devil's Kitchen. Soon after, we rested on the Hogsback, gearing up for the serious part of the climb.

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      The Hogsback is a spine of snow that forms every year in the back of Hood's crater. Its lower section is the last flat spot on the mountain before the summit, offering respite to both ascending and descending climbers. Along the spine toward the summit, the slope gently increases until it becomes quite steep. The infamous bergschrund lies where the spine approaches verticality and creases the permanent snowpack. The solidity of the Hogsback snow bridge over the bergschrund often determines whether an entire route is doable at a given point in the season.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Allegedly the Hogsback can shift its path east or west every year, leading up to different points on the crater rim. This year, it leans eastward toward the Pearly Gates. And while the menacing bergschrund was open, visible from our resting point, a reasonably firm snow path still bridged the gap.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      We preferred the route up the Hogsback and through the Pearly Gates. There is an alternate route to the west, skirting around the bergschrund and up the Old Chute. The Gates, however, are the iconic crux of the South Route. They are steep, exposed to long falls, and are a natural funnel for falling debris. But they wind a hundred vertical feet through towering rime ice - a close up, intense experience with a snowy realm that is possibly unique to this mountain. So, after weighing the risks one more time over snacks, we resolved to head up the spine and over to the Gates. We readied our gear - helmets, crampons, ice axes - and began the final ascent.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      Fifty steps in, we marveled at the mountain's grand beauty. A hundred steps in, we thought only of the route's increased steepness. Then, we met the bergschrund and possibly the riskiest next step of the day. The crevasse was open mere feet to our left, its icy blue walls haunting below the snow. We could not see its bottom. It was only three feet wide, but we would have to make one step onto the snow bridge, over thin air. We made it quick: one foot down on the bridge, an ice axe plunged hilt first into the uphill slope, and the next foot forward onto firmer ground.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      The mountain allowed us through this first major obstacle, but did not let us pause for relief. As we perched directly above the bergschrund, a cloud materialized. In an instant, we were in a whiteout. We could barely see the icy cut we had just crossed. We convinced ourselves that if we waited, the sunny morning would return. It did for a few minutes, and we pressed upwards, away from the crevasse. But the clouds soon settled in again, obscuring our vision and stoking our fear.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      A lot of unknown remained ahead of us. We worried the firm snow that had accepted our steps thus far would give way to solid ice ahead, making unroped travel considerably more dangerous. If we made it to the summit, our route would take us over a dangerous knife edge traverse to the Old Chute, our descent route. We would then have to locate the chute in unfamiliar terrain. These were all serious obstacles in any conditions. Now we could only see ten steps ahead. It was difficult to make out features in the snow. Simply looking down and finding a solid place for a boot was hard.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      And yet, a descent from this point was not without risk. Falls are more common on the way down, and we could not fall here, hovering over the bergschrund. Going that way, we would have to take another step - another gamble - on the snow bridge. We decided to move forward.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      We began the thirty foot traverse off the Hogsback and to the Gates. The slope here was steep enough that, facing the mountain, we plunged our axes into snow at chest level. We stood a couple hundred feet above the Devil's Kitchen basin on a snow ledge, tamped down by previous climbers, just wide enough to hold our feet. Progress came in inches. Right foot right on a step kicked into the snow, right hand's axe into the snow, left hand's axe following, then the left foot following. Cautiously, we edged around to the bottom of the Gates.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      Without lingering, we started climbing. Looking up, I could see two fifteen feet wide chutes, the Left Gate and the Right Gate. We would go left, following the most popular route that day. Fifty feet overhead was a monstrous block of the mountain's hallowed rime ice. The Left Gate passed around it and narrowed into a choke point before turning out of sight.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      I watched my partner plunge both of her ice axes into the snow in front of her face. She lifted a foot and, looking down, picked its next placement, slightly higher on the mountain. She kicked vigorously, her crampon and boot toe chopping out a sturdy place to stand. When she felt confident, she shifted her weight to that foot and did it again with the other foot.
    </p>
    <figure class="article-img">

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      In this steady way, we tackled the slope. The snow generously accepted our prods and kicks, giving way so we could find purchase, but not so much that we were not supported. Still, each step was another chance to slip, and that we could not do. We tested every axe placement, every foot placement, before trusting it with our weight and wellbeing. We devoted maximal attention to our task. We looked back on the long slope beneath us, acknowledging it, but never letting the fear of it break our focus. We flowed bravely, strongly, up the chute and out of the Gate. The summit lay a hundred foot walk from us.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      While we toiled in the narrowest section of the chute, I allowed myself a moment to look in awe on the rime ice. Rime forms when supercooled water from the air comes in contact with solid surfaces. It famously forms on airplane wings high in the atmosphere. On Hood, when winter storms bring sub freezing fog and winds, it plasters the rocky precipices. It is airy, like a popcorn ball with space between the kernels. Because it can build upon itself, it forms gravity-defying protrusions, arms that reach out from the cliff and twist skyward. I looked up and around me, surrounded by a Gothic cathedral of ice, grotesque and beautiful. I wanted more time to take in this novel environment, but its inherent danger kept me moving.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      We stood on the summit, proud and relieved. We were completely socked in. Lacking the view one hopes for atop such a prominent mountain, we recounted the ascent of the gates and congratulated each other. We ate lunch, sucked down water, and decided to keep moving.
    </p>
    <figure class="article-img">
      <img class="article-img" src="./img/hood_walking_on_summit_ridge-resized.jpeg"/>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      The preferred descent on the South Route is via the Old Chute, west of the Pearly Gates. The Gates are more narrow and steep than the Old Chute. On busy days, they are clogged with climbers. Downhill traffic is more dangerous there, and it increases risk of rock or icefall accidents. The Old Chute gives more space for climbers to spread out and falls there are less consequential.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Still in a whiteout, we followed footprints off the summit and to the west, toward the Old Chute. The path narrowed onto the knife edge ridge, steep rime-choked gullies on the left and the thousand feet of the mountain's north face on the right. We made ginger steps across the ridge, always looking for the entrance to the Old Chute.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Concerningly, nothing obvious appeared. Had the clouds parted, we would surely have seen a wide gully with inviting snow leading into the vast bowl below. But in our circumstance, we relied on morsels of information to navigate - primarily the footprints of our predecessors. Now, checking our GPS, we felt we were about to pass the Old Chute entirely.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Footprints continued along the sharp ridge. A faint path seemed to drop down a snow slope to our left. In the whiteout, it was hard to know if these were someone's steps or just natural undulations in the snow. Besides, a set of tracks down does not guarantee a safe route. We considered our options. No direction sounded appealing. If our GPS was to be trusted, forward seemed incorrect. Backward was over the knife edge again and we were sure we had not passed a more obvious way down. The slope to our left was steep and we could not see far down it. We had no way to know what waited below it - the mellow Old Chute or a deadly drop?
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      We decided to test the gully. For the next half hour, we kicked steps into the sheer snow, descending slowly, always probing for hints of what lay downhill. In all that time, we only made it down a hundred vertical feet. It was an unpleasant situation. We began to feel the remoteness of the terrain. On a clear day, from this vantage, we might have seen our car 5,000 feet below - a mental tether to civilization. Today, stuck high in the clouds, we felt alone.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Fear made us yearn to be off the mountain immediately. I noticed peculiar thoughts intrude. My brain considered, for the briefest moment, whether I might roll the dice and try sliding down the slope. Anything to release the intense pressure of the moment, consequences be damned. But we continued to move and to reevaluate our plan as we progressed. We checked in on each other. And above all, we focused on the job, dedicating each new moment and each next step to our safe exit.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      At last, we heard voices nearby. We paused, looked at each other, eyebrows raised, then yelled out. A group answered. They were in the gully next to ours. A minute later, visibility improved enough for my partner to see them. They were close! We continued our descent. In the lead, I rounded the bottom of a rime fin and saw the other group. There was a clear path to their position. We still had hazards ahead, but now we felt relief. We were confident we were on the right path, had more partners for support, and knew the dangers between us and the Hogsback were just the ones we had planned for. We traded a few sardonic jokes with the other group and all the sudden we were having fun again.

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      Down the Old Chute we went. I stomped through the snow while my partner skidded on skis. At the bottom, we traversed over another fumarole, dangerous but less feared after the ordeal up high. And then we were back on the Hogsback, in relative safety, gearing down and allowing ourselves to relax. Light on our feet, we left the crater and began a joyful return to the car.

    <p class="text">
      Now below the whiteout and in open snow fields, we let loose. My partner skied long lines, dropping hundreds of vertical feet in seconds. I threw on rain pants, sat atop the slopes, and launched into long glissades.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p class="text">
      We dove, slid, sliced, and plunged  our way down the mountain. A mere two hours removed from the crucible up on the high cliffs, it was easy to disregard how trying our situation had been. We were giddy with pride and exhaustion. But, standing in the parking lot looking again at Mount Hood and the full route before us, we remained deferential. We were lucky for the ability to climb, the opportunity for this experience, and most of all for safe passage in the harrowing terrain. Fortified and accomplished, we resolved to go back at it again soon.
