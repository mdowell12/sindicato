    <h1>The Brothers</h1>
    <h2>Oct 15, 2022</h2>
    <p class="text">
      On a Friday evening, I embarked from Seattle in Subine towards The Brothers, three companions in tow. The Brothers sit prominently in the Olympic range when viewed from Seattle.
      They are often on the mind of the city-bound dreamer, trapped in some mid-week drudgery, whose westward gaze looks on the peaks in search of wilderness and adventure.

      We aimed to climb the South peak, the taller of the two, via a nine mile approach from Lena Lake Trailhead. We would climb over
      6,000 feet before reaching the summit on Saturday. But first, after arriving at the trailhead Friday night, we began a hike in the dark to
      Lena Lake where we would camp. After setting up camp at 10pm we went to bed, planning for a 6am start the next day.

      In the morning, we left camp as we'd arrived: under the light of the stars. The sun rose as we wandered The Valley of the Silent Men, as it's known. Our headlamps shone
      on green fields of moss draping the valley floor to our flanks. Upon reaching climber's base camp, a kind canine greeted us, her initial challenge
      rendered toothless by our pets and scratches. Nova, the Golden Princess, marked the arrival of the full light of day. She would later and occasionally
      serve as our guide to the summit as she and her owner joined us on the climb.

      After filling up on water, we exited the trees for a burned meadow and the start of the climb, our objective glowing in the morning sun far above
      our heads. We were prepared for a grueling ascent, and the trail met our expectations. Loose dirt and fallen trees littered the relentless incline.
      We dipped under and saddled over blown down logs, a full body engagement as we gained 2,500 feet in a mile or so. The grade would increase from there.

      Another hour of taxing climbing had us fighting talus and scree, each step forward half erased by a downward slide. We reached a narrow gully
      with solid rock, marking the beginning of our scramble and the final 1,000 foot push for the summit. Helmets on, we resumed the upward crawl.

       A chute like this one provides a low-risk opportunity to practice rock climbing skills. Small hand holds were plentiful on the sturdy boulders
       clogging the gully. Cracks and corners were easily found and made balance points for wedged feet. The chance of falling was low and a fall would
       rarely have proven consequential, allowing for light minds and swift stepping. The crew sped upward, finally gaining the summit ridgeline and panoramic views.

        distance, but allowed for the dramatic silhouettes seen here.

       Minutes later, we met Nova at the summit, where she'd preceeded us by fifteen minutes or so. Spirits were quite high after the climb. The crew enjoyed a well-earned
       lunch break, lounging between rocks and guessing the names of distant peaks. In pursuit of these mountains, we think often about minimizing the weight we carry.
       Any luxuries that one allows themselves should at least be packable and light. But on this summit, two of us confirmed - yet
       again - that a decadent lunch is a reward that justifies virtually all extra weight and space. This time leftover squares of Dino's pizza from Capitol Hill, emerging two
       days old and from deep in our packs, rejuvenated our bodies and minds.

       Eventually, someone said the magic words that start the end of the trip: it was time to return home. Reluctantly, the others agreed. We rose up on creaky legs, and began the six hour downhill trek. It can
       be difficult to leave a ridgeline like this one. We'd worked hard to stand in this place, surrounded by vast open space below us in every direction. The view
       is a reminder of the myriad opportunities for adventure nearby. With so many peaks to climb and valleys to explore, a bittersweet awareness paints the first few
       dozen steps toward home: it's possible, even likely, that we'll never stand on this ground with this exact view ever again. There's a temptation to halt progress,
       to try and absorb more of the experience and to hold on to it for a just little longer.

       But time keeps on ticking, and a check with reality reminds us that night will come. It'd be nice to be back in the car by then.
       We dropped back into the gully and acquiesced to gravity's pull, meandering down the moutainside toward home.
