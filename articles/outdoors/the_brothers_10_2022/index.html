    <h1>The Brothers</h1>
    <h2>Oct 15, 2022</h2>
    <p class="text">
      On a Friday evening, I embarked from Seattle in Subine, three companions in tow. Our destination was The Brothers, or one
      of them anyway. The two Brothers sit prominently in the Olympic range when viewed from Seattle. They are often on the mind
      of the city-bound dreamer, trapped in some mid-week drudgery, whose westward gaze combs the peaks in search of for wilderness and adventure.

      We had aims to take the South peak, the taller of the two, via an seven mile approach from the Lena Lake Trailhead. We would climb over
      6,000 feet from the trailhead before reaching the summit. But first, we pulled into the trailhead and began a nighttime hike to our
      overnight site at Lena Lake itself, about 3.5 miles and 1,000 vertical feet up the trail. We arrived at 10pm and went to bed, planning for a 6am start
      the next day.

      We left camp as we'd arrived: under the light of the stars. The sun rose on the valley - The Valley of the Silent Men - and we saw the green
      fields of moss drape the flanking ridges. A kind princess greeted us at climber's base camp (7 miles from trailhead), her initial challenge
      rendered toothless by our pets and scratches. Nova, the Golden Princess, marked the arrival of the light of day and would later and occasionally
      serve as our guide to the summit.

      After filling up on water, we left the trees for a burned meadow and the start of the climb, our objective glowing in the morning sun far above
      our heads. We were prepared for a grueling ascent, and the trail did not disappoint us. Loose dirt and fallen trees littered the relentless incline.
      We dipped under and saddled over blown down logs, a full body engagement as we gained 2,500 feet in a mile or so. The grade would increase from there, where an
      encounter with the Choss Queen was forecasted.
