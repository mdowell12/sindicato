    <h1>Collar Mountain</h1>
    <h2>October 28, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Three hikers walked along the Pacific Crest Trail in the mountains near Snoqualmie Pass, where the season's first snow had fallen. They traveled a soggy trail through tall pines, switchbacking up and up. Then the trail took them out of the forest. The sky opened up, a blue that was uncomplicated but deep. They looked up at the peaks that decorated the valley rim, craggy and dusted white.

      Everything was dressed in the new snow, which was not yet a permanent feature of the mountains. Instead, it was like a sweater, tried on, not yet committed to. As the hikers continued, they marveled at the fluffs of powder on the trailside boulders. They scooped handfuls of it. It sifted through their fingers like desert sand. It was still crystalline, youthful, unmarred by the sun.

      The season was changing, which the hikers discussed. Summer was a distant memory. New colors now, and colorless winter was around the corner. Really, they talked of the passage of time. How snow on these slopes would pile and melt in fits and starts, then thicken, pack down, grow, slide, shrink, grow more. Before too long, now a consolidated mass, set like concrete, it would grow no more, and it would melt until it was gone. Another season waxed and waned. They thought that they were lucky to catch the mountains in this time of transition. To be out on this pristine day, to be part of this frozen scene, was to briefly stop time.
