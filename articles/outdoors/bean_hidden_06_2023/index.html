    <h1>Bean Peak</h1>
    <h2>June 17, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Three friends and two dogs left the Beverly Turnpike Trailhead on a recent Saturday morning in the Teanaways. They were headed for Bean Peak, a 6,743 ft. pinnacle above the Bean Creek Basin. They started the hike at 11 a.m. after an indulgent morning at camp.

      One of the dogs, Arvy, belonged to two of the humans. Arvy had previous experience in the wilderness, having been raised as a hiking dog. Often, when cooped up in the city, she would lie on her porch, staring at the surrounding trees. She would think of the open forest, where she was allowed to roam off-leash.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Wendell, on the other hand, was a city dog through and through. He did not like to get wet. His nails were long, elegant, uneroded by the trail. He had anxiety.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      The day before, Wendell's family had left Seattle on a trip. Arvy's family was hosting him for the week. Like a child brought on a friend's family vacation, he was expected to go along with whatever unfamiliar activities or customs were pushed upon him. Yet, unlike such a child, he was unable to voice any argument in opposition. He was put in the back of the car with Arvy, driven a hundred miles from home, and introduced without fanfare to the great outdoors. He whimpered all the way.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      The gang made their way up Bean Creek via a trail that weaved through Ponderosa pines. They crossed the creek, hopping between basketball-sized stones. Switchbacks brought them up the creek bank and into the forest. Following the creek, steadily gaining elevation, they passed a dozen-foot waterfall.

    <p class="text">
      Arvy, untethered, raced ahead of the group. She had a keen sense of when she was too far forward. She would pause, looking far up the trail. Then she would wheel around and gallop back to the group, like a scout returning with news from the front.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
      Wendell, though, had lost roaming privileges early that morning. Over breakfast, he'd made a trip to a neighboring campsite, where he'd helped himself to food that was not his. Perhaps he thought he'd find a rescue at the neighbor's site. Instead, he found himself on a leash and a dusty trail. He stepped gingerly across the creek and over fallen trees. But he kept pace with the group. His leaders even considered that he might be enjoying himself. They wondered if he knew what lay ahead of him. They imagined him remarking that this was such a nice walk, totally unaware that every step forward was another step he'd need to take on the way back. The day was far from over for him.

      Three miles in, the creek valley opened wide. Mountain ridges framed the basin on three sides. A meadow spread across the basin floor, reaching up the mountain sides to the treeline. Bean creek meandered lazily through the grass field that was speckled with wildflowers. Not so high above stood Bean Peak, at the junction of the north and west ridgelines.

      Though the Teanaway mountains are minor in comparison to their neighbors, they offer excellent scrambling opportunities with short approaches. Bean is a standout among these peaks. Its summit block is a small tower that caps a ridge of yellow-brown rock. Mixed among these rocks are stretches of serpentine, an emerald green mineral prevalent in this area. Caught in sunlight, it shines like snake skin, shorn in smooth, glassy surfaces. The rock is solid, fixed firmly to the mountain in large, protruding blocks. Many cracks and gullies cut through the stack on the summit. It is a dream environment for a climber wanting a casual day moving through the alpine.

      All of this was likely lost on Wendell as he looked from the edge of the meadow, tongue to the wind. His hosts pulled him along the boot path that crossed the field and headed for the ridge. As the incline gradually sharpened, so did Wendell's anxiety. It's unclear whether he thought his hosts malicious or deluded, or if he had the capacity for such thoughts at all. The poor dog did not like heights.

      Pushed, dragged, coaxed, prodded, he scaled the steep and loose dirt. Now hundreds of feet above the treeline, he crested the ridge. He watched Arvy prance among the rocks, enjoying the rare alpine air. The humans found smooth stones and took a seat, catching their breath after the strenuous climb. He saw them savor their reward - panoramic views of The Enchantments to the north, newly visible from the ridge. As they snacked and laughed, he stood there, slack jawed. Perhaps he wondered how these strange folks could pair the physical and mental anguish of the climb with this lightness. Or perhaps he thought nothing at all. Again, it's unclear.

      The humans began the few hundred foot traverse to the summit block, where the final scramble remained. Rock by rock, they persuaded Wendell to continue on. It was his first experience climbing. For some, when they first put hands on rock, they discover an affinity for it. They pull on a sturdy hold, shift weight onto a stretched foot, wedge it into a crack, lever, push. They find a new kind of flow. They experience grace. But Wendell did not. His long nails, boons in the city, scraped along the rock. He looked up at the route with fearful eyes. After he'd been hoisted by human hands through two of the route's cruxes, he'd simply had enough. Though he could not form words of protest, he did execute a perfect sit in. He found one of the few remaining flat spots on the route - a nook under a large boulder - and lay down. His message was clear. The humans elected one of themselves to sit with him while the others tagged the summit.

      There concluded Wendell's summit attempt.  He would return later that day to the lowlands and to civilization. How had he changed? Did he look upon his scuffed paws, his dulled nails, impressed by his contact with the rugged wild? Now safe in the back seat of the car, was he proud of the work he'd put in to access a remote place, to stretch outside of his comfort zone and experience something new? Did he reminisce fondly on the vast landscape that unfolded below him after he'd climbed, of his own power, onto a high alpine ridge? Was he better for it all? Was there anybody in there? Once more with gusto: it's unclear.
