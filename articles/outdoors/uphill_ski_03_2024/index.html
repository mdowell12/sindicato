    <h1>Skiing Uphill</h1>
    <h2>March 22, 2024</h2>

    <p class="text">
    	I've been learning to backcountry ski this year. A major part of that is skiing uphill. Last fall, I bought boots and skis that could be switched into "walk mode". When I move forward in them, my heel lifts from my ski and my toe drags it upward. I stick skins to the bottom of my skis which catch on the snow instead of sliding backward. With all this, I'm able to travel up a snowy slope at about the same speed as hiking - and sometimes more ergonomically.

      In February, I hucked my setup - plus an array of new avalanche rescue gear - onto a mountain for my first backcountry tour. Two friends and I climbed and skied a ridge across Interstate 90 from Summit at Snoqualmie, one of our local ski resorts. We understood our route to be friendly to beginners. And yet, six hours after leaving the trailhead, we emerged from the woods with sore bodies and egos, laughing on the comedown from sustained nervous tension. We'd fought through dense branches to climb steep, firm snow most the way up the mountain. We constantly checked our phones for navigation - reading the minute details on topographic maps like tea leaves as we sussed out the most mellow slopes. We avoided inviting terrain in open meadows because open fields on a mountain slope are often paths of past avalanches. Back at the trailhead, I looked across the highway at the crowd of folks meandering down the resort runs and thought, "I bet they had a lot more fun than we did today."

      When considering this new hobby of mine, if you take away the backcountry element - the avalanche specter, the navigation challenge, the remoteness - you've still got skiing, albeit with a lopsided effort to reward ratio. Snoqualmie, like many ski resorts, delineates a few uphill routes that skirt their groomed runs. Folks can use these routes to skin up the ski hill, then ski down within the resort's bounds. I started doing this in December, figuring it was good practice for the real deal in the backcountry. I'd learn to use my new gear, then I'd get in shape to use it on big mountains. But a few months in, I've grown fond of the practice in its own right. I head up to Snoqualmie pass and sweat my way uphill while jovial downhill skiers breeze past me on their way back to the lifts. They might get in five runs to my one. Still, I've felt right where I belong.

      I'll admit that this is a contrarian's way to ski; I may be drawn to it just because it's different. To skin uphill on a crowded day at the resort is to swim against the current and all its schools of fish. As I plod uphill with my friends, we stand out, and maybe we are special.

      And it's cheap, and I'm cheap. When I learned that I like skiing a couple years ago, my stomach hurt thinking how much it would cost. Gear aside, the resorts charge staggering prices to ride the lifts. A day pass at Snoqualmie - by no means the most expensive resort - costs more than $70. An unlimited pass for the season is over $800. The popular Ikon season pass, which gets you into a couple of local resorts and many across the globe, starts at around $1,000. A season of uphill skiing, however, will set you back $50 and some burnt thighs.

      In keeping with the times, most resorts have been bought up by one of two large corporations. They charge high prices because people keep paying them. As I've learned to ski, I've been one of those folks. I've paid for passes, driven to the resort before sunrise, fought for parking, and stood in long lines for lifts. I've waited my turn at the top of runs as hoards of people flew down in a continuous stream. Halfway down runs, surrounded by other skiers and boarders in an unchoreographed dance, I've been hit by claustrophobia. It can be like walking through a packed train station where every tenth person walks 30 mph. I was bothered by some cognitive dissonance as folks around me didn't bat an eye and kept paying the money. Don't get me wrong, I was having fun. But I did not like feeling beholden to these companies and this culture.

    <p class="text">
      So now I've got uphill skiing. I can tramp up the mountain and raise a middle finger to the resort and all the people on the lifts above me. I'll pay for my turns with sweat and I'll keep my dollars for something more valuable, thank you.

      And it certainly is sweaty, even when the temperature dips below 20 degrees, even as I am surrounded by snow. A single trip uphill at Snoqualmie gains between 800 and 1,000 vertical feet over a mile. For those of us hiking regularly, it's nothing to write home about but it's certainly work.

      No surprise, this is one of the attractions. My job keeps me in a chair for most of the week. I've found this affects how I spend my leisure time: to feel happy with myself, I seem to need to do something physically difficult at least once a weekend. Though it is actually a good leg workout, a day spent at the resort doesn't scratch the itch. For some reason my brain puts it in the same box my job occupies: easy, conventional, overly affluent. But if I haul my ass up the mountain and breathe hard before I ski down it, then I've checked some mental box that makes it alright. Having lugged myself to the top, I've gotten stronger. I convince myself that I've made progress toward something. Or maybe I'm just a dog on a walk after being cooped up all week. Regardless, I enjoy the work.

      It never hurts that this all goes down in the mountains in winter - a reliably charming setting. The peaks across the highway from Snoqualmie have become familiar to me over many trips. Craggy, snow-pasted ridges divide the bending valleys. Uniform acres of evergreen dress their flanks. On a clear day, these mountains are a blessed backdrop to all the sweating. One evening after work, after-hours at the resort, a few friends and I stood at the top of a run that waited for us, and only us. We beheld the western face of a cliff band across the highway as it glowed proud in the tangerine light of sunset.

      It all adds up to a feeling of freedom. Freedom from the gravitational pull of consumerism, where the habit of spending money at the resorts requires perpetually more money and staying at my unsatisfying job. There's also the freedom gained from self-reliance. When I ski down the face of Snoqualmie's Mount Hyak after hiking up it, I'm proud that all it took was me and the gear on my body to make it happen. (This ignores the work the resort did to groom the trail and clear the Hyak face of trees - oops!). The pursuit of fitness is another grab for freedom - freedom from the effects of age, maybe. When I skin uphill, I feel like my life is still moving uphill too. I'm getting faster; stockpiling strength I'll need for bigger things to come. There's a lot left in life to work for and to get better for. So pity me not if you find yourself on a chairlift, floating over me and my toil. I am in a happy place, and there I will stay.
