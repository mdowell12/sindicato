    <h1>The Enchantments</h1>
    <h2>October 7, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      As we flew between stars in his rickety old ship, he told me to keep my mind open. But I was resolute. I had been abducted by this man, this stranger, my father. He was some kind of recluse. But he showed up when my mom got sick, and now he had taken me from my friends and my planet. His ship was so small, probably two hundred years old. There was only enough room for me to bring a bag of clothes and my handheld. I hated him.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      And then we landed on that new planet, my new home, and it all changed. We had dropped through the atmosphere into a mountainous scene, the sky light blue under a thatch cloud roof. He guided the old ship toward a wide basin between rows of peaks as I looked out the front view port. Mountains stretched for miles below us. Far on the horizon, there seemed to be some arid plane. Our basin sat higher than the surrounding land, and its peaks were taller than any of those around us. He set us down lightly on a slab of gray stone in the middle of the valley.

      The ship powered down and he went back into the cargo bay. Then he returned with some gear. He handed me a light, long sleeved shirt, a tough pair of boots, and a wide brimmed hat.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      "You'll need some coverage from the UV while your skin adjusts," he said. His skin was tan and hard. Mine was pale and soft.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      "No oxygen filter?" I asked.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      "Not out here," he said, smiling. When he smiled, his leathery face folded into a hundred small wrinkles. His teeth and eyes were bleached white. After I put on the clothes, I followed him out the exit port and down the gangway.

      The light hurt my eyes at first, then they adjusted and I looked out on an alien landscape. Something like what I had seen in pictures of planets without cities, but still different than anything I had imagined before. Fields of rock spread from the ship to the horizon, where a wall of pointed peaks hemmed in the valley. Golden trees littered the stone. They seemed miniature in the vast, rugged surroundings. Their branches were covered in yellow needles, bristled like flaming pipe cleaners. Pockets of sapphire dotted the landscape where water pooled. A pleasant breeze made the branches sway and pushed ripples across the water, and the ripples caught the light from the sky and sparkled like gemstones.

      My father began walking along a dusty path between giant stones and I followed. I had never been outside without a full respiration suit before. I felt naked. The air stung as it chilled my lungs. I could feel the power of the sun's rays, even through my protective clothing. It gripped me. But I could feel my body drinking all of this in, wanting more of it. I was more aware of myself than I had ever been.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      We wound between ship-sized boulders and then down a slope to one of the pools, where the golden trees were more plentiful. They shaded us from the unyielding light. Between the trees and their parchment trunks, a green heather covered the ground at knee height. It was interspersed with crimson patches that held pods of bright yellow fruit. He told me not to eat them.

      We stopped at the edge of the water and looked upon a stone spire that towered over the other side. It shot up five hundred feet, increasingly steep, gray with long streaks of black. The face culminated in a single point that caught the bright sunlight on one side and glowed orange. It was a sentinel guarding the pool.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      My father stood there and stared up at the tower. The sun shined on his face and lit it up like it did the rock. Then he stooped, made a cup with his hands, gathered some water and drank.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      "No!" I shouted, horrified. He spit the water and laughed hard.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      "You can drink this," he said. "C'mon, try some. It hasn't been contaminated here. Not yet, at least." He gathered more in his hands, sipped, then offered it to me.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      The water in his hands was perfectly clear. There were none of the suds that came from the cleaning agents they added back home. Lines of bright sunlight flashed across his rough skin as the water danced in his hands. I took a sip and found that it had no taste at all. It was almost weightless. But, like the crisp air I breathed, it percolated through my body, chilling and life-giving.

      "We'll spend the night up here," he said. Then he left me. He walked around the rim of the pool, scrambled up a cleft in the rock and continued up. He was like a spider, limbs sprawled, core shifting, pulling and pushing his way skyward. I sat in the shade, back to a tree, watching him scale the rock. Surrounded by this unfamiliar, fresh beauty, I wondered why the hell he would do that.
