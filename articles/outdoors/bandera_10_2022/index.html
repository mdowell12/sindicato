    <h1>Bandera Mountain</h1>
    <h2>Oct 23, 2022</h2>
    <p class="text">
      The last month was filled with hikes that required a fair amount of preparation, long days
      outside, and tiresome car rides. Then came this weekend, an emphatic turn of the season here in the
      Northwest, and finally a reprieve from planned trips. On Sunday morning, I embarked from Seattle in Subine
      towards the Interstate 90 corridor and Bandera Mountain for an impromptu hike alone.

      Bandera is a round top in the chain of mountains lining the interstate on the way to
      Snoqualmie Pass. The mountainsides here are crossed with trails, many of them wide and well groomed.
      Their proximity to the city makes them popular hikes and the greatest technical challenge one meets
      is often finding a parking spot at the trailhead. But I've come to cherish a number of days spent along
      these trails. The easy terrain makes for a light mind. The popularity makes me more comfortable traveling
      solo, and I'm often able to sneak away from the crowds to enjoy a bit of solitude. Clarity/presentness/pride/awe
      seem to reach me more often on these trips than on hikes to more remote or marquee destinations. These are
      moments when I am most aware of what I get out of time outside.

      Thick clouds and wildfire smoke hung low in the valley as I left the Ida Springs trailhead. With summer's exit, the hallmark
      dampness of our region lay on the leaves and the dirt under my feet. Vibrant oranges and golds decorated the steadily climbing path. In
      gaps between clouds, I could see that the tops of neighboring mountains faded into white snow. A leisurely climb up a mountain is still
      a climb up a mountain. My heart thumped, sweat gathering under my green beanie, soaking through my wool shirt. In contact with the autumn
      air, it was invigoratingly cool.

      Two miles into the hike, I followed an offshoot from the main trail that beelined uphill toward the summit ridge. Before long, I'd reached
      the snowline. First a dusting bordered my path. But higher up, talus fields topped with white fluff looked like a scattering of
      marshmallows.

      The wildfire smoke, still lingering after a weeks-long fire to the North, smelled like a campfire. As I gained
      the ridge, the surrounding clouds opened to a blue sky above my head. Consolidating into lumpy ramparts, they twisted
      slowly before my eyes. Whispy arms unfurled from the towering columns, fading away into blue space. The sun emerged and warmed my face.

      The trail to the top of Bandera gets you to a false summit known as Little Bandera. The remaining half a mile or so to the true summit
      is a faint boot path along the ridge that hadn't been traveled since the snow fell. I picked my way between snow-laden trees and boulders,
      losing and finding the trail a number of times.

      I had heard that the true summit was not a popular destination
      for most Bandera hikers because it is covered in trees and offers no views. Well chalk that up to fake news - I crept up
      a final boulder field to panoramic views of the valleys in front and behind the mountain.

      It was a moment to celebrate the pleasures unique to this momentary transition in seasons. Pristine snow dressed the evergreens in the surrounding
      highland while patches of orange screamed in contrast below, highlighted by the sun. For likely the last time this year, I found a dry rock for my bum,
      where I sat and enjoyed a quiet lunch.
