    <h1>Bandera Mountain</h1>
    <h2>Oct 23, 2022</h2>
    <p class="text">
      There was an emphatic turn of the season in the Northwest this weekend. Summer closed and with it came a reprieve from planned trips.
      On Sunday morning, I embarked from Seattle in Subine for an impromptu hike up Bandera Mountain alone.

      Bandera is a rounded top in the chain of mountains that line Interstate 90 near
      Snoqualmie Pass. The mountainsides here are crossed with trails, many of them wide and well groomed.
      Their proximity to the city makes them popular hikes and their greatest technical challenges are often met at the trailhead
      when finding parking. But, even with the extra company taken into account, I've come to cherish a number of days spent on
      these trails. The easy terrain makes for a light mind. The popularity makes me more comfortable traveling
      solo. I'm often able to sneak away from the crowds to enjoy a bit of solitude and adventure off trail. On these trips, perhaps moreso
      than on trips to more remote or marquee destinations, I find the mental clarity, the self confidence, and the joy
      that makes the outdoors so important to me.

      As I left Subine and the Ida Springs trailhead, thick clouds and wildfire smoke hung low in the valley. The hallmark
      dampness of our region wet the leaves and the dirt under my feet. Vibrant oranges and golds decorated the steadily climbing path. In
      gaps between clouds, I could see that the tops of neighboring mountains were dusted in snow. My heart thumped as I marched out the steady
      incline over the first miles of the hike. Sweat gathered under my beanie and soaked through my wool shirt. In contact with the cool air, it was invigorating.

      Two miles in, I followed an offshoot trail that beelined uphill toward the summit ridge. I'd surpassed the treeline
      already and soon reached the snow, an abrupt departure from the autumn scene behind me. As I climbed, the snow deepened. Talus capped
      with white fluff spread like a field of marshmallows. I felt like I'd entered a different world.

      After a mile of steep hiking, I gained the ridge where surrounding clouds opened to a blue sky above my head. Consolidating into lumpy ramparts, they twisted
      before my eyes. Whispy arms unfurled from towering columns. They dissolved into blue space. The smell of campfire lingered in the air after a weeks-long fire to the North,
      and the sun warmed my face. I felt a comfort that belied the wildness of the environment I stood in.

      The trail along the ridgeline ends at a false summit known as Little Bandera. The remaining half mile or so to the true summit
      is a faint boot path that hadn't been traveled since the snow fell. I knew it would be difficult to find the booth path under the
      unbroken snow, but I was motivated to get to the true summit.

      Leaving the trail behind is a scary thing. The trail is a lifeline back to the car, stocked with fellow travelers who might help if something goes wrong.
      As I plodded between snow-laden trees and boulders, I was lost and found my way a number of times. Doubt crept into my mind. Time seemed to slow down.
      I felt more observant of my surroundings. Eventually, I found tiny paw prints that marked a path of least resistance and I followed them forward.

      Truthfully, I was pushing for the true summit just to say I'd done it. I had read that it is covered in trees and offers no views to improve upon those
      of the false summit. But as I crawled through a final boulder field and reached the top, I found panoramic views of the valleys in front and behind the mountain.
      To the south was the interstate three thousand feet below. Eastward, I could see Granite Mountain behind a veil of clouds.
      Down the backside of Bandera, I could see alpine lakes draining into the Middle Fork valley.

      It was a moment to celebrate the transition in seasons. Pristine snow dressed the evergreens in the
      highland while patches of orange screamed in contrast below. For likely the last time this year, I found a dry rock to sit on.
      I enjoyed a quiet lunch before starting downhill.
