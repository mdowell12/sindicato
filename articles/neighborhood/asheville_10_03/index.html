        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        This entry was written following Hurricane Helene's destructive arrival in Asheville, North Carolina, where I'd gone for a wedding that wouldn't come to pass. Instead, Asheville and much of the region suffered unprecedented flooding and wind damage, a one-two punch that knocked out water, electricity, cell service, and transportation options in the days following the storm. Many of those necessities remain inaccessible to those affected. The death toll, as of this writing, has surpassed 230 people.

    <p class="text">
    	Last Tuesday, in Asheville, North Carolina, I worked from Sweets and Seats, a "restaurant focused on pastries, cakes, coffee, and outdoor furnishing". It was a time of decadent and pristine order. From a display case lined with pastel macaroons and rich cake slices, I chose a humble cookie, delivered to me in a plastic wrapper. It was <b>Pleasant</b> and overshadowed by a <b>Superlative</b> latte served in a solid, spherical mug. Calming jazz played on the speakers (<b>Headphones Out</b>) while I surfed the <b>Snappy</b> wifi, pretending to work. The clientele: <b>Youthful Hip</b>. The staff: <b>Kind</b>. The atmosphere: <b>Warm</b>. Elbow Room: <b>Present</b>. This was a fine place to work on a day that was like any other, and yet so distant from any day the walloped town will see for a while.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Rain began in earnest Wednesday evening, a precursor to Helene. My friend Katie was there with me. We'd come early to explore the area and booked a garden unit in Kenilworth, a neighborhood south of downtown with large trees and stylish old homes. Its narrow roads curved and branched with the hills, an asphalt web in an urban forest. But now, in the weather's first volley of the week, the roads siphoned sheets of water into the lowlands. As we drove to Westville Pub, a neighborhood dive in West Asheville, the rainwater drained down ditches, periodically geysering out of culverts that couldn't keep up. We cut through a hotel parking lot to bypass a flooded road, then saw a car swamped mirrors-deep. Carefully, we made it to the pub and enjoyed dinner and a beer, then picked a route over high ground on the way back.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      When Thursday morning came it still rained, though more softly, and all discussion of the weather was nonchalant. As we ate breakfast at Sunny Point Cafe, our waiter told us we were lucky - normally folks waited two hours to eat there, but the rain kept the line down. Details of Hurricane Helene's coming were unclear. Was this rain part of the hurricane or not? So much rain had already fallen, and excepting the flooded lowlands, the city kept moving. If the weather hadn't knocked things over already, they'd surely stand up to more of the same. So nobody worried. When the groom emailed us to cancel Thursday night's welcome dinner, it was out of an abundance of caution, and I brushed off texts from friends asking if I was aware of what came our way.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Still, caution abundant, Katie and I decided to stay in Thursday night. We hit the grocery store. I grabbed a gallon of water. Katie: "You really think we need that?" Me: "You're right, that would be nuts." I put it back. By chance, I stopped at the gas station to fill up my rental car, too.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Back at the apartment, the rain stopped and we went for a run. We followed a road down to the Swannanoa River, which borders the south side of the neighborhood. At this point, the river swelled but didn't escape its banks. It flowed hastily along the road we ran. We got to Biltmore Village, then back uphill to home, where we cooked dinner and relaxed into the evening, unaware that much of our route would be under a dozen feet of water by next morning.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      On Friday, I woke up around 5 a.m. Outside, in the dark, trees swayed violently. I watched their tops, seventy feet up in the air, swing a dozen feet each way with the gusting wind, and the rain fell with energy. It was all amusing - I missed watching storms like this, which never come through Seattle. I checked my phone for news, then read a G.Q. article about Billy Strings. I wasn't worried that my battery was almost drained because I'd just charge it when I got up, I thought, unaware that the power was already out.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I woke up again at 8:30 a.m. Katie came out of the bedroom and said some water had seeped onto the floor there. I thought little of it - our landlord, Bob, who lived in the house, had mentioned he'd dealt with similar issues in the past. But soon, he knocked on our door and told us he'd had a rough morning. He'd been bailing water on the unfinished side of the basement for hours. It turns out the foundation is drained by a sump pump that runs on electricity, and of course there hadn't been any electricity for awhile.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Can we do anything to help?", we asked.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "No, no, heavens no. You all are sweet", he said, holding the bucket he'd been using to move water. "This is all supposed to let up around noon, so I think if I stay ahead of it until then, it should be fine."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      He kept bailing for the next two hours. Katie and I steeped coffee in cold water while we napped and read. Outside, the storm whipped the trees and the rain blew in sideways walls. It had come and punched a little harder than we'd given it credit for, but the damage seemed nothing more than a few inconveniences.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Things settled outside. Bob, having caught up to the inflow in the basement, took a break and assessed the damage in our apartment. Katie had contacted friends in the wedding party and learned their flights into Asheville were canceled. Someone reported that the bride was at a hotel without running water. Still, we figured Katie would attend the rehearsal dinner that night and certainly the wedding would still be on the next day. Hoping to do some recon for the bride, Katie and I got in the car. We'd poke around and see how bad the roads were, where there was power, what was closed.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Over the week, I'd followed Google Maps' directions off of or onto the Kenilworth hilltop by at least four different routes. We tried the direct route downhill from our apartment and found it blocked by a large tree. No problem. We turned around. Then we found the main street blocked, too. At an intersection, a tree draped over powerlines, pulling electrical poles down with it. We tried another route and it, too, was blocked. We were stuck in the neighborhood! It was a fun surprise. We kept driving around, avoiding downed powerlines on most streets. We saw a few houses hit by trees. In one driveway, two cars, side by side, were smashed by the same tree. We drove into an alley under a low hanging powerline, holding our breath as we passed, then found a way out of the maze.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Everything outside the neighborhood was closed and no stop lights functioned, besides one or two downtown. We followed Biltmore Avenue through downtown, all the way to Beaver Lake in north Asheville. The water there was brown, the lake brimming. We walked across its earthen dam to a crowd gathered near its spillway.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Where is the dam?" said a kid.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      An older man gushed, "Our little creek...".
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The outflow through the spillway frothed like a Himalayan mountain stream and pummeled the woods downhill, which hardly seemed ready for the beating.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Back in town, we stepped into an open cafe. People lined up twenty deep for drinks, and we saw most of the baked goods were gone. A market down the street was open, too, and a long line of people waited to pay cash for packaged food and soda. Strangely, a guy played a Playstation shooting game on a wall-mounted TV next to the register.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      We continued back toward home, then went to Biltmore Village, the commercial district along the Swannanoa that we'd run past the night before. Water here rose to the roofs of the businesses throughout the low valley. The river stretched a quarter mile across and in its main channel, debris shot downstream at thirty miles per hour. A delivery truck floated by, surrounded by couches and lumber pallets. There was a smell of gas, maybe from the submerged Shell station, but we weren't sure.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Soon, a stocky woman in her late sixties approached.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "People, if the dam breaks, a rush of water will come through here faster than you'll be able to move out. It'll go as high as that police car up the road."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      We looked at the police car, at each other, and lazily began walking uphill. It seemed like people believed her, but there was no urgency. Just rubbernecking and storytelling.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      We returned to Kenilworth via our circuitous route from before and learned the water was now off. Cell service diminished, but Katie had received some texts and we'd learned the rehearsal dinner was canceled. No surprise. Friends outside Asheville were stuck in D.C. or Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      But we still thought the wedding might happen the next day. I joked that I might not have time to buy a tie. It was in line with a pattern of optimism, or naivety, common through the weekend. Repeatedly, we assumed things weren't as bad as we'd later find out. We'd hope the power or cell or water would come back soon, then it wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Surely flights will be going out by Sunday?" Bob said at some point with a look of exasperation.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I think cell will be back quickly. It's a signal broadcast from a central place, and they only need to fix the central place," I said with unjustified confidence.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
       But also, we saw how many trees had toppled powerlines. They'll be cleaning that up for weeks, we thought. Any news we got was word of mouth, passed among those wandering the streets as they gawked and stretched. At some point in the afternoon, cell service completely disappeared.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Katie and I went on a long walk. We went back to Biltmore Village, where we saw The Weather Channel trying to do a broadcast. The anchor stood in a rain jacket with the flood to her back and said into the camera, "The Swannanoa River crested 26.1 feet above its bank this morning." She waved her hands as she talked and we watched her like cows chewing cud. "This storm has obviously been so devastating for the communities here."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      A couple of folks nearby talked of a shelter that might be handing out supplies, but nobody was too perturbed. A guy mentioned his bar down the street, probably flooded, but he had no way to check. The Weather Channel boom operator, a middle-aged guy with big headphones and a backwards hat worked a wad of gum. "They lost us", he said, and the broadcast stopped. We took a final look at it all and walked home.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      We ate room temperature spaghetti and roasted vegetables from the night before. Katie emptied the remaining water from the pipes into some bottles she found in the cabinets. We read and wrote til dark, then hit the sack, still thinking that if the power came back overnight, the wedding might be on.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      But, when Saturday morning came, it hadn't. Water and cell service hadn't improved, either. We steeped enough coffee for a cup each - worth the price in water in our estimation. In the bathroom, we'd taken a queue from Katie's days in drought-stricken California: If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown flush it down. But, after more than enough yellow accumulated, I took the bucket of rainwater Bob gave us and dumped it into the toilet for a manual flush. We heard later that the hotels had residents carry pool water to their rooms to do the same.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      We planned to do another recon drive. We had no idea what was going on in the world outside of our neighborhood. Had the storm affected other cities? Was anybody working to fix the utilities? Katie took a walk to see if she could find enough service to make a call. She made it through to some friends in Charlotte, who said everything functioned normally there. All flights in and out of Asheville were canceled.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Katie got back and we caught up with Bob who told us that he'd heard I-26 was open, which would get us out of the mountains and on our way to somewhere else. It dawned on us that we might be best served to simply drive ourselves out of the situation. The wedding was clearly off, and in hindsight it'd been doomed since Thursday morning. If we waited for the airport to resume flights, we might be stuck indefinitely. We had three liters of water between us, some hiking snacks, a couple of apples and some salami. It seemed unthinkable that we could run out of food or water, but then again we had no viable plan for replenishing them if we stayed.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      We talked it over. There were risks: we might drive far only to learn the highway was closed. We might get stuck in gridlock, maybe overnight out in the mountains. We had separate rental cars, so we'd need to drive separately, and if we lost visual contact with each other, we'd have almost no way of finding each other. But we felt we had enough gas, food, and water to give the escape a try.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Outside the house and down the road, a crew of neighbors gathered to clear the big tree that blocked the intersection. One man had been roaming the neighborhood, and perhaps the town, in his red van with a large gas-powered chainsaw. He went at the tree with vigor, at times straddling trunks six feet off the ground as he cut them down. Two underlings materialized with a punier chainsaw and an ax. They took his orders - spoken in an Australian accent that added to the surreality - and broke down his large pieces into carryable chunks. Katie and I joined the folks piling the detritus on the sidewalk, and soon a car-width path was cut through.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Of course an event like this brings the community together a bit. Even if only because folks had nothing to do but walk around and help. Still, a barrier of awkwardness stood between the volunteers. I'd only exchanged nods and grunts with the others before we disbanded. I did see some neighbors meet each other for the first time, exchanging names. "We see you around all the time!". An outdoorsy couple told us they'd filled their bathtub with water before service stopped and they asked if we needed any. On one of our long walks, a mother asked us if we'd seen two thirteen-year-olds playing. "Tell the one who looks like me to check in with his mom", she said. An older lady told us the mayor would give an update on FM radio at 4 p.m.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      As Katie and I readied to leave, we walked down the street one more time to see if we could find cell. Suddenly, Hope and Andy, the bride and groom, appeared on the street, joined by Andy's brother and sister-in-law. They'd driven as far as they could and walked more than a mile uphill to check on us. It was a wild surprise. Did this happen regularly in the time before cell phones? Friends might show up unannounced at any time? I liked it and I wish it happened more.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The wedding was indeed canceled. They were in a hotel downtown and told us they'd paid cash for food from a chinese restaurant, where cooks fired sesame chicken on the gas stove under headlamps. They were in good spirits, all things considered. Everyone was. We said things like "this is nuts", but it almost felt like we only said it because it seemed like we should. No one was alarmed, no one particularly in awe. And yet, we rationed water. As we parted with Hope and Andy, they casually asked if we were leaving any non-perishable food. I think there was a pervading sense that the situation couldn't get too bad, because the powers that be wouldn't let it. So people bided their time, using any ingenuity they could to make small improvements. They waited for some more powerful force to address the monumental and intractable challenges that the town faced. It was a strange feeling to be surrounded by so many who had so little control of their own fate, something that reminded me of the early days of COVID.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Hope and Andy had heard I-26 was closed and would reopen overnight, but when we asked how they'd heard, we agreed their information was equally hearsay to ours. We'd stick to the plan: drive I-26 out of the mountains to its junction with I-85, which we knew could get us to Charlotte. From there, we'd find a hotel or hop on flights home. Katie and I divided up the remaining food and cash, rehearsed the route, and vowed to try and meet at the nearest McDonalds if we lost each other.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      As we drove through town, we passed closed grocery stores and gas stations jammed with cars. Before he'd left, Andy mentioned cops had started guarding grocery stores to prevent break ins. Downtown, we saw dozens of people loiter outside hotel lobbies, sitting in the bushes and in parking garages as they surfed the hotel wifi. Strangely, one antique store was open for business.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      For the first time, I felt nervous. Out on the highway, every overpass was stuffed with cars in line for gas, the lines often hundreds of cars long. With the talk of looting and the folks gathered outside the hotels, it was easy to wonder if the seams holding everything together had started to split. I was glad that we were on our way out, but also uneasy about the road ahead.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      To our good fortune, travel on the interstates was smooth. In less than an hour, we crested the eastern continental divide, then popped through a mountain pass where views of the open flatland spread below us. I briefly got two bars of cell service and let out a breath. The bars went away, but it was the first sign that there was indeed relief coming. We dropped out of the mountains and continued our cruise onto I-85 and toward Charlotte. Barring a couple of slowdowns, we had no trouble getting there.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      At some point along the road, gas stations lines disappeared. Full 5G service and a flood of worried texts hit my phone. I called my parents and they, more than anything, were surprised that we hadn't taken the most direct route to Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "You could have saved a lot of time if you'd cut over on Highway 74", they said.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I was operating on a verbal description of the route," I replied, a bit confused. It started to become clear that the outside world was not aware of what was happening an hour down the road behind us.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Around 4 p.m., Katie and I pulled off the highway near the airport and called the airlines. I had a non-refundable, non-changeable ticket, but received some leniency from American Airlines because of the storm. I was soon booked on a 6:25 p.m. flight. Katie would fly out a bit later. We said hasty goodbyes and rushed to the airport. Within an hour, I was through security and wolfing down a barbeque chicken platter from one of the counters in the terminal. People drank beers and watched college football next to me. Without time for any sort of gradual transition, I now had plenty of food, water, unfettered access to the internet, and I was bored. I watched a guy showing his partner footage of the storm. "Wow. Oh my god, that's a whole house floating!" They laughed in awe. I sipped my seltzer water and stared at a wall, while nobody asked me anything about any of it.
