        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

      Second in this series is Oxbow Bakery, a remote work destination that, for me, sets the bar for all others. Oxbow sits in the middle of Montlake’s leafy retail corridor; its neighbors include Cafe Lago and Montlake Bike Shop. It is run by the folks from Sea Wolf Bakers, which makes much-loved bread sold at many restaurants and cafes around the city. Reportedly, Sea Wolf opened Oxbow when its owners wanted extra space for bagel-making machinery. Three years later, Oxbow produces plenty of bagels and has Present Elbow Room to boot.

	     Not only is the space ample, it is divided in a way that inspires thought. The high-ceilinged room - ductwork and rafters exposed - is split down the middle by a serving counter where folks pick from Oxbow’s offerings. As they peruse the bagels, spreads, salads, and pastries, they look beyond the counter to the other side, where the food is made. There, constantly, a handful of bakers with flour-matted aprons shape pale dough. Watching these folks work, one is aware of the skillful human effort behind the product on the shelves. And the business seems to appreciate this, too: equal portions of the open space go to those doing the labor and those enjoying its fruits. Instead of hiding in a back room, the work is a proud feature of the experience.

    <p class="text">
	     This respect for craft shines through the employee-customer interaction. Here, a member of the staff, which skews young and hip, stands on equal footing with the customer. Like, say, on a recent visit, when a woman in a sleeveless Oxbow t-shirt took my order. She had short hair with blonde highlights, and tasteful, minimalist tattoos on her arms. She brought a sturdy friendliness to the register - not one born of obligation, but instead of self-assuredness. I have the sense that the customer may not always be right at Oxbow - someone who works here is here to do a job they enjoy and to do it well. You are welcome to share in the joy if you come with respect too.

      I ordered a latte and, thrillingly, a slice of pizza. It is a pleasure that they have pizza. I love that they have pizza. I chose a slice with pineapple and jalapeño, which the staff warmed as a man assembled my drink at the coffee bar opposite the counter. I found an empty two-seater and soon was ready to work, drink and pizza in hand. This was a Pleasant latte, solid in all the right ways, and I enjoyed drinking it. The pizza, however, earned Oxbow a Superlative in Quality of Victuals. It was a charmingly greasy slice, with an airy crust, charred and sooty.

  	   Enamored of my snack, I thought, “Now this place has really got it going on.” I took a look around. The environment was Warm in spite of the industrial decor, perhaps due to the firmly Kind staff. My fellow patrons were a mix of remote workers and young socialites. The genre: Youthful Hip. Two women, near college age, sat at the table in front of me, laptops out. One wore baggy jeans and an oversized sweatshirt, the other an orange jacket over pastele pants, and they nursed matching cold brews with cream.

      “So we finished eating, and the waiter comes and asks together or separate”, said the girl in baggy jeans. “I opened my mouth to say separate, then Sarah said ‘together’ before I could get anything out.” She rubbed her eyes.
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “So, like, it was a date.”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “I don’t know.”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “Did you want it to be a date?”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “I just had this feeling something was going on. All of our friends talk about how great she is so maybe I felt like I should explore it.”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “Explore it?”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “Yes.”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “Like on a date?”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “I don’t know.”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “Seems like you should have known.”
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The girl with baggy jeans curled her upper lip and cupped her hand in an asking gesture.
    <p/>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      “Don’t just let things happen to you, Mia,” said the girl in pastele pants.

    	I was glad to have my Headphones Out and the WiFi, when I got around to using it, proved Snappy.
