    <h1>A Sunday at Seward Park</h1>

      Mid-morning on a recent Sunday, dozens of Seattlites wandered Seward Park. For the uninitiated: Seward is a peninsula that juts into Lake Washington
      from southeast Seattle. Were the mainland the back of a left hand, the park would be its green thumb. Designed by the Olmsted Brothers and named after
      the man who bought Alaska, the park offers hundreds of acres of forest crisscrossed by walking trails.
      The main attraction, a 2.5 mile paved loop skirting the peninsula's shoreline, held the majority of this morning's amblers.

      The crowd moved with diverse speed and purpose. Many procreators pushed their offspring in strollers. Their serious faces meant business, not pleasure.
      Dog owners were led by their leashed compatriots. The humans hoped the canids might burn off energy before a lazy afternoon. But weren't the humans
      doing the same thing for themselves? Runners weaved around groups. Slower folks stopped to look around. They gazed upward at especially large trees,
      or outward over Lake Washington's emerald surface. One slowpoke, circumnavigating the loop at a ponderer's pace, encountered the same runner three
      separate times. This was an ambitious runner, coming up on at least their eighth mile of the day. Or perhaps they were a glitch in the matrix,
      a background character the slowpoke wasn't supposed to notice more than once. Who can say?

      On a warmer day, one could expect to find Seattlites swimming. But today, the humans and their tag-alongs kept to terra firma. The aquatic world was
      ceded to the ducks. Multiple species were out for a Sunday float. Left and right they would glance before bobbing their heads underwater, searching for food.

    <p class="text">
      Is it generosity that persuaded our world's maker(s) to grant the Seward Park Seattlites time for a stroll? Recall, the ducks weren't actually
      there for a Sunday float. They did this every day. They had to, to eat and to survive. When they looked around before they went under for food, were
      they taking in the scenery? Were they appreciating the freshness of the park's air before they held their breath? No, unlike the Seattlites, these birds must check for danger before they eat.

    <p class="text">
      But, then, it's doubtful they ever face the big questions, like What are they doing at the park, or on this planet anyway? They've never
      considered how much one might spend for a life of leisure and more leisure, only to learn that leisure has diminishing returns. Maybe the
      recipients of divine generosity were the ignorant ducks.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
      Now, now. There were lots of smiles at Seward on this day. The herd of city slickers had braved a light rain to be there. They sucked down fresh air and they were surrounded by natural beauty. As they traveled around the loop, their souls' cups were topped off, and they were ready for the start of another week.
