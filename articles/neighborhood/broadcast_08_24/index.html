        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

      	Recently, I spent a Friday afternoon at Broadcast Coffee on Yesler. It's the original Broadcast location, of which there are four. One is in Boise, Idaho, the hometown of Broadcast's founder, Barry, and the rest are here in Seattle, where Barry moved after college. He came to this town seeking independence, adventure, and acceptance. When he opened this cafe in 2008, "the goal from the get-go was to spread love and acceptance through hospitality and delicious drinks".
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      	A worthy aim, sure. But lofty? How strong can a coffee be? Well, I have never had a weak one at a Broadcast location, and today was no exception. I took my cup of black - <b>Pleasant</b> and punchy - to one of the two-seaters along the side of the cafe. Elbow room was <b>Lacking</b> today, due in part to the weather. It was a dreary day - the cap on an unseasonably rainy week in late August. What is it about the rain that brings people out?

    <p class="text">
      	Broadcast's Yesler location has varied and inviting seating. A high table, great for a social group, splits the center of the space. The booth and tables where I sat are well-suited for individuals on laptops. Finally, low countertops abut the floor-to-ceiling windows that make up two of the cafe's sides. Today, a handful of gray-haired birds sat at the social table, looking at their phones, and the rest of the seats were filled by remote workers (the clientele leans lightly <b>Capitalist</b>, at least during the week). Concrete flooring, high ceilings, and dim lighting set a mood that, on a sunny day, may dull the spirit. But on this drab day, as the rain streaked down the big windows, the setting flourished, quintessential of an atmosphere that is <b>Pleasantly Not Warm</b>.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      	But remember Barry's goal. How could this chilly environment follow through? At first glance, the scene here was no picture of love. Isolation, more like it. A dozen folks and I peered into our laptops. The way we avoided contact with, even acknowledgement of our fellow workers, inches away in some cases, was effortful. Yet, in spite of the lukewarmth, a common thread ran through the room. While we typed and sipped, retro hip hop played low on the speakers (<b>Headphones Out</b> here) and, softly, we clicked, clacked, slurped, and sighed to its beat. Feet tapped, gears turned. Work flowed from our fingertips and we made progress in our discrete digital worlds (it must be said: the Wifi today was <b>Slothful</b> and work did not come easy). We were a league of productivity, not separate in home's solitude, nor together in an office. We were here, independent, but also next to each other. There was solidarity in the quiet toil, if not in the linking of arms, and we savored delicious beverages and treats (a <b>Pleasant</b> chocolate chip cookie from Temple Pastries, underbaked and with large salt flakes for me). This was love. In spite of the corporate activity in our computers, often so alienating, we felt a loose connection to the human world in this place. This was belonging.

      Forty-five minutes before closing, I approached the counter and asked for a refill. When the barista, whose <b>Kind</b> smile showed behind an N95 mask, saw me reach for my credit card, they said, "Don't worry about it", and poured me a new cup, on the house. The carafe was headed for the sink soon, so it just made sense.
