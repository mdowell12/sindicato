      On a recent Tuesday, I drove up Greenwood Ave looking for a place to work. It was one of those wet and wolf-toned February days in Seattle. The only thing that moved much was the light rain falling from the sky. Cruising north along the four lane street, almost beyond the neighborhood of Greenwood, I found Diva Espresso.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Diva joined the Seattle coffee scene in 1992 and has since expanded to seven locations. This outpost is on a corner in a nondescript grey building, dwarfed by a three story apartment building to the south. There is no sign outside. Just some print on the door and a neon "Open" sign. You might confuse it with an insurance broker's office.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      There was no line when I walked in. The shop was cozier than the outside suggested, with an open interior and valuted ceiling. An unassuming barista took my order: a drip coffee and a croissant. She pulled the croissant off a pile of pastries - the regular bulk fare from some local wholesaler. She handed me my coffee in a to-go cup and I added cream.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      A few pairs of elderly folks took the tables along the windows (Clientele: <b>Joyful Geezer</b>). They outnumbered the remote workers to start, but as the late morning hours passed, the crowd grew more professional.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The coffee was <b>Pleasant</b> and so was the croissant. The staff <b>Kind</b> enough. They'd decorated the white walls with a few inoffensive landscape paintings, leaving much of the space bare. A fake wooden floor, some brick on the pillars in the middle of the room, a single potted plant. It was a halfhearted attempt at atmosphere, but it had the basics. The WiFi was <b>Snappy</b>, the elbow room <b>Present</b>. I don't remember what music played, if any. Soft conversation prevailed, work-related and not (<b>Headphones In</b> if you want to focus). 
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The lacking atmosphere was maybe a blank canvas. I found it uninspiring at first - like nobody here strove for anything so I might as well do (or not do) the same. But there were few distractions. I didn't need to conform to the cafe's expectations of me - I could use it however I wanted. I didn't feel welcomed with open arms, but the barista's lack of attention made me feel like I could stay under the radar. This was a suitable place to get work done after all (Atmosphere: <b>Pleasantly Not Warm</b>).
    </p>

      Two people in their late 30s sat across from each other with their laptops open. The woman wore black slacks and a green sweater. The man draped a long, wool overcoat over the back of his chair.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I am going to lose it," the woman said after half an hour.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "This party." She pinched the bridge of her nose.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The man looked up from his screen. "Marco again?" he said.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The man sipped his cappuccino.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Has he gotten worse?"
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I think so. I feel bad, because this is of course a hard time for him. But, like, we need to nail down a venue so that I can move forward. We needed that yesterday."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The man checked his phone for a moment then said, "He's always been hands off. I appreciated that about him. But lately his direction has been pretty vague."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      They ducked back into their laptops. He typed, she clicked her trackpad once or twice.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Why are we even doing this? Nobody has fun at these things."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      After a moment of consideration, the man said, "Well, I just feel like it's a good opportunity, in the new year, to bring all of ops engineering together."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      He looked outside the window for a moment, as if to give what he'd said the space he thought it deserved. Satisfied or not, the woman returned to her computer.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      An older couple, long past working age, remained at a table in the corner. They, too, talked of conflict, no less urgent for the lack of corporate stakes. A bit out of earshot, I caught enough to get the flavor of their conversation. From the man, a poem:
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="poem">
      If you were worried I would do this,
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      why wouldn't you talk to me?
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      I do like the Subaru.
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      I like the shape of it.
    </p>

    <p/>

    <p class="poem">
      Take me to the dealer
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      I will not in an accusing way,
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      find the answers to your questions.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      4/5 stars.
