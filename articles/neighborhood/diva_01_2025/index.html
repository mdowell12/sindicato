      On a recent Tuesday, I drove up Greenwood Ave looking for a place to work. It was one of those wet and wolf-toned January days in Seattle when the only thing that moved much was the light rain falling from the sky. Plodding north along the four lane street, almost beyond the neighborhood of Greenwood, I came upon Diva Espresso.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Diva has expanded to seven locations in the region since its 1992 start. This outpost is on a corner in a nondescript grey building, dwarfed by a three story apartment building to the south. There is no sign outside. Just some print on the door and a neon "Open" sign. It could be mistaken for an insurance broker's office.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I parked on a side street and walked into the shop which was cozier than the outside suggested. It's a spacious cafe with an open interior and a vaulted ceiling. In sunnier times, one might take to the outdoor patio where they'd feel like that sat within the neighborhood, maybe with views of the Olympics to the west.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I asked for a drip coffee and a croissant from the unassuming barista.  There was no line and we weren't in a hurry. She handed me my coffee in a to-go cup and I added cream. She pulled the croissant off an ample pile of pastries, probably delivered in bulk by some local wholesaler.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Nobody was striving here. The coffee was Pleasant, and so was the croissant. The staff  Kind enough. They'd decorated the white walls with a few inoffensive landscape paintings, leaving much of the space bare. A fake wooden floor, some brick on the pillars in the middle of the room, a single potted plant. It was a halfhearted attempt at atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I grabbed a seat along the windows opposite the bar. A few pairs of elderly folks took the tables nearby (Clientele: Joyful Geezer). They outnumbered the remote workers to start, but as the morning hours passed, the crowd grew more professional.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The WiFi was Snappy, the elbow room Present. I don't remember what music played, if any. Soft conversation prevailed, work-related and not (Headphones In if you want to focus). And that lacking atmosphere was maybe a blank canvas. Few distractions. I didn't need to conform to the cafe's expectations of me - I could use it however I wanted. I didn't feel welcomed with open arms, but the lack of attention from the barista made me feel like I could stay as long as I liked. This was a good place to get work done, after all (Atmosphere: Pleasantly Not Warm).

    <p class="text">
      Two people in their late 30s sat across from each other with their laptops open. The woman wore black slacks and a purple sweater. The man draped a long, wool overcoat over the back of his chair.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I am going to lose it," the woman said after half an hour.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "This party." She pinched the bridge of her nose.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The man looked up from his screen. "Marco again?", he said.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The man sipped his cappuccino.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Has he gotten worse?"
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I think so. And I feel bad, because this is of course a hard time for him. But, like, we need to nail down a venue so that I can move forward. We needed that yesterday."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The man looked out the window, then said, "He's always been hands off. I appreciated that about him. But lately his direction has been pretty vague."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      They ducked back into their laptops. He typed, she clicked her trackpad once or twice.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Why are we even doing this?", she said. "Nobody has fun at these things."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      After a moment of consideration, the man said, "Well, I just feel like it's a good opportunity, in the new year, to bring all of ops engineering together."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Satisfied or not, the woman returned to her computer.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      An older couple, long past working age, remained at a table in the corner. They, too, talked of conflict, no less urgent for the lack of corporate stakes. A bit out of earshot, I caught enough to get the flavor of their conversation. From the man, a poem:
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="poem">
      If you were worried I would do this,
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      why wouldn't you talk to me?
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      I do like the Subaru.
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      I like its shape.
    </p>

    <p/>

    <p class="poem">
      If you take me
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      to your Subaru dealer,
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      I will not in an accusing way,
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      find the answers to your questions.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      4/5 stars.
    </p>
