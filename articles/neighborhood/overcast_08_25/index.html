          When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

          In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

        Overcast Coffee has two locations on the Hill: one on 15th and another on 12th. The 12th Ave spot is the larger of the two, though still a bit small for comfortable remote work (Elbow room: <b>Lacking</b>). A large wood-topped bar takes up the right side of the space's single room and limits seating to the few tables along the left wall. But it's a nice place to grab an above average cup of coffee (Quality of bev: <b>Pleasant</b>) and a snack (Victuals: <b>Pleasant</b>, too). A potted tree on the bar adds canopy to the <b>Warm</b>, midcentury atmosphere. The <b>Kind</b> staff is almost certainly spinning vinyl on a deck somewhere in there for the mostly <b>Youthful Hip</b> clientele. If you're able to snag one of the tables and plug into the <b>Snappy</b> WiFi, keep your <b>Headphones Out</b>. But not for the music - for the special eavesdropping.

        Overcast is next door to the Seattle Police Department's East Precinct headquarters. This is the building that protestors occupied following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. The cops have long been back in the building and, at any given time, there are half a dozen patrol cars parked outside, including in front of the cafe. Officers often stop into Overcast to buy a mid-shift coffee.  Citizens, while they wait in line with the police, feel some inclination to confess not-quite-crimes. As if this line and its rare authoritative composition, where folks are momentarily on equal footing with a dispenser of justice, offers a chance to get something off the chest that can't be passed up. The cops, maybe as part of an ongoing effort to repair community relations post-2020, or perhaps because they are trapped in line, seem to tolerate it.

        One man in a sand-colored pork pie hat and sweater vest: "Officer?"

      <p class="text">
        "Yes?"
      </p>

        "My girlfriend of seven years - I've been feeling lately that she's not the one."

      <p class="text">
        "Yes. It's driving me nuts. I care for her. I do. And we get along well. We like the same movies, we bike along the lake most weekends, she's a great cook. I would even say that I'm happy - most of the time at least. You know?"

      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "Know what?"

      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "Well, happiness..." He chewed on his bottom lip. "It's just that she doesn't light me up. You know that The Doors song? Light My Fire? I always thought when I was a kid that I would find someone who did that."

        These conversations happen frequently at Overcast. Two weeks ago, a large and bald man in his late 40s waited on a sausage and egg breakfast sandwich. Soon, unable to hold himself back, he revealed something to a young female cop.

      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "Until two weeks ago, I didn't even know what a 'Brat Summer' was. I thought it had something to do with encased meats," he said. "Which was weird because I didn't even think kids ate meat anymore."

        Officer looks up from phone, but not at guy.

      <p class="text">
        Guy pauses, doleful eyes locked on officer. Officer looks over.

        Pause. Eyes.

        Two months ago, a guy in a striped button down and slacks shut his laptop, stood up from his table and walked to a plainclothes cop in line.
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "I just referred to my coworker's on-screen baby as 'it' four times during a half hour Zoom call."

      <p class="text">
        Why did he feel the need to say that?
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Once, a chef from Spinasse - the Italian restaurant down the street - stopped in at the start of his day. He wraps his knuckles on the shoulder of a cop who'd just ordered two coffees to go.
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "Hey, got one for you buddy."
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "What's that?" says the cop as he slips the two cups into sleeves.
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "I committed the crime of murder last night."
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        The cop turns to leave.
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "Boiled a lobster. It was murder in the 212th degree." He laughs. Like, head thrown back laughing. The cop does not laugh.

      <p class="text">
        Are they thrilling themselves as they flirt with danger? Do they feel the unbearable weight of guilt?

      <p class="text">
        Today a sinewy man in a tank top with a shaved head and the smallest curl of a grin approached a tall detective. He says, "Officer, I've committed a carnal sin."
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "Sin is not crime," says the detective.

      <p class="text">
        "Bestiality?"
      </p>
      <p/>

      <p class="text">
        "Yes, <em>that</em> is a crime."

        "What?"

        "I know Lisa."

        The guy breaks into a full on grin.

      <p class="text">
        "Aren't you gonna do anything to me?" he says.
