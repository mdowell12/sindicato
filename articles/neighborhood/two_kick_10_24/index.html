        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

      Two Tuesdays ago, I took two hours to take in Two Kick Coffee, a two-in-one cafe and motorcycle garage in Queen Anne. You read that correctly: here, in a single stop, you could work a spreadsheet and then a sparkplug.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Do you have a project in mind for your bike but don't have the space or tools? We have you covered with lifts, compressed air, 3D printers, shop books, and just about every tool you'll need and a few you won't. From an oil change to custom fabrication, you will be able to do it here."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Oh, the possibilities that come to mind. Sure, I'll participate in a "design jam to generate feedback for our website's new login button". But when I grow bored I'll go off-camera. I'll jump over to my bike whose carburetor lies bare next to the 3D printer. I'll shoot compressed air across its valves, freeing it of stifling gunk, knowing how we'll soon fly on the open road. Then I'll step back over to the laptop, wipe the grease from my fingers, and click my camera back on, just in time to give the new user experience a thumbs up and fake smile.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      If only I had a bike.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Even so, maybe whiling away in my virtual world <em>next to</em> real people making real things would scratch a certain itch. So I went to Two Kick. But when I got there I didn't see any bikes on lifts. Sure, the space featured a large ceiling in an open brick room with the paraphenalia of a working garage (the actual garage is next door). But the clientele was decidedly <b>Capitalist</b>.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I ordered a coffee and croissant, then found a seat in the loft area hanging in the upper reaches of the garage-like space. On the way, I passed two middle-aged men in plaid collared shirts, blue slacks, and brown loafers. One stared at his laptop, the other spoke audibly into his airpods. Three folks sat at a table near me. Two men and a woman, also middle-aged. All three wore light down vests; one of the men wore Vans and the other a pair of boat shoes.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I'm no longer a figure pusher," the woman said. "I give advice, and I want to work with companies I care about that can use my advice." 
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      She took a sip of her drink. The men nodded. 
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      As she waved her hand in a rainbow arc, she said, "Let me know if you want to work with me. If not that's ok."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "What if we say we want to work with you and you say you don't have time?", said the older man in the boat shoes.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I will have time," she replied. "Yes, I'm getting old. I turned the big 6-0! But age is an attitude. You look in the mirror and decide how old you are."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      It was a pitch. It made me feel tired. I figured by time you hit the big 6-0, you'd be done selling. Everyone around me was hustling. The cafe was hustling. I preferred a world where the work spoke for itself. Where fast talk was neither required nor rewarded.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      And Two Kick just wasn't cutting it. The place felt disingenuous. My coffee was lukewarm (<b>Disappoint!</b>) and my croissant phoned in (<b>Disappoint!</b>). None of the following contributed positively: the <b>Slothful</b> WiFi, the <b>Not Kind</b> staff interaction, the <b>Not Warm</b> atomsphere. I don't remember what they played on the speakers, but I kept my <b>Headphones In</b>, if only to avoid my neighbors' business-speak. One saving grace, perhaps a symptom of the other shortfalls: elbow room was <b>Present</b>.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      But there's also plenty of elbow room on the open road. Somewhere out there beyond the city limits, a person noted that they didn't need a two-in-one cafe garage. Not because they didn't own a bike, but because they didn't own a laptop. They putzed through town, stopping at every red, keeping the noise down. When they hit the edge of town, now through last light, they opened the throttle and the bike responded. Gradually, they moved up through the gears, picking up speed with the grace of someone who had time on their side. They looked ahead along the asphalt ribbon and they left everything else behind.
