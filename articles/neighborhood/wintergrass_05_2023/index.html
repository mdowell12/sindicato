    <h1>Wintergrass</h1>

      On a Friday evening at the Hyatt Regency in Bellevue, the region gathered for Wintergrass 2023. Wintergrass is an esteemed bluegrass festival in its 30th year. It draws top bluegrass and Americana musicians from across the country along with a crowd that is bimodally distributed in age.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
A solid representation of earnest youth were present, dressed more rurally than is typical of the Seattle area. Presumably, those in jeans and work boots had traveled from less populated lands into suburban Bellevue for the music. But the dandies in their suede fringe jackets and wide-brimmed fedoras? Surely less genuine.

Regardless of age, people were here to enjoy, create, and pay homage to the music. They came for the artists on the bill, but also for the action in the hallways between shows. Folks brought their instruments and played in impromptu jams. Tables of merchandise lined the walls. Walking down the halls felt like passing through rooms in a big house party, where every few steps brought new sounds, new merch to look at, new conversations to listen in on.

Still, the most potent magic of the evening was made by the professionals. Bella White opened the first of two sets in the Regency Room that stood out. Bella is a 22 year old self-styled old soul from Calgary who, under the influence of her Virginian father, grew up listening to bluegrass. On stage tonight, she was accompanied by a standup bassist and a fiddler.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
White released her first album, Just Like Leaving, in 2020. Most of her set drew from this album. The songs focus on family strife, particularly her parents' divorce and her accompanying sense of loss. It's a serviceable substrate on which she drapes an exquisite melancholy, sweet for any fan of old country western. Pick a song from the album, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOvj9y7H0hs&ab_channel=BellaWhite">"Do You Think About Me At All"</a>, and you will recognize the chord progression, melody, and harmonies. These are throwbacks, and they are well done.

Listening to Bella on this night was like going to a restaurant and finding a dish your mom cooked when you were a kid. Bella nailed the replication and her listeners reminisced on a beauty they felt they knew.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
But the show was more than a well-crafted tribute. On a night with plenty of impressive instrumentalism, Bella's voice punched through. She sang with an old-timey warble that matched her nostalgic theme. It seemed to swell with effortless spontaneity, blossoming up and out like a mushroom cloud. Singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbw_cHpE-JA&ab_channel=BellaWhite">"The Hand Of Your Raising"</a> with her band, she intertwined in three-part harmonies that made the crowd's arm hair stand. Yes, this was mom's cooking, but you had to admit that Bella improved on the old recipes.

Hawktail was in the primetime slot and attracted a standing room only crowd. They are an acoustic quartet out of Nashville, individually well known in the bluegrass community, formed into a band in 2018. A fiddle, a guitar, a mandolin, a bass and no voices, they are closer to the sound one expects at a bluegrass festival. The packed crowd chattered as they waited for the band. They shuffled as ushers made more room for listeners arriving late. Finally, Hawktail took the stage.

To kick things off, the four musicians eased into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GLkj5uGDiw&ab_channel=Hawktail">"Abbzug"</a>. It was a fiddle-forward tune that opened with Brittany Haas, the fiddler, laying down a slinky riff. Guitar and bass came in, then finally mandolin, each adding drops of sound to flavor the riff. The four snapped into rhythm, fueling Brittany's riff as it increased in tempo. The crowd tapped their feet with the band and then, without warning, the band took off. Brittany's riff was a sprint now and the rest of the four pounded out a thumping beat. Listeners whooped and stomped.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
They launched us through hairpin turns, slammed the brakes, slowed us to pensive lulls, then burst back up tempo. Haas, shredding her fiddle and pulling her listeners on marionette strings, did it all with a sly grin. She was in complete control. In fact, the whole band shared a cool confidence. It was all effortless, even the banter between songs, though the music itself was anything but casual. Whereas Bella White's charm was the bashful, raw beauty of youth, Hawktail had the comfort of knowing what they were offering and letting the crowd take it or leave it, while knowing for sure that they would take it.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
They wrapped up their set to much adoration, and the listeners filtered back into the Hyatt's hallways. With the primetime slot passed, the crowd thinned. The elderly slowly made their way out of the hotel. The youth gathered in jam circles that would linger through the wee hours. Less formal sets would play the stages until midnight. Bluegrass would reign through the weekend, when Wintergrass concluded and the old music left Bellevue for the hills.
