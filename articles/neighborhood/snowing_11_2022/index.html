    <h1>Snow for the Early Risers</h1>
    <h2>November 29, 2022</h2>
    <p class="text">
      They say Christmas music gets the green light once Thanksgiving has passed. Does a White Christmas get the same
      nod? On this November morning, Capitol Hill woke to flurries and, with a generous interpretation of the rules, maybe
      a little White Christmas.

      Once an oddity, neighborhood locals now count snowfall within the city limits as a once-annual regularity. The
      city's preparation for this yearly event pretty much amounts to standing ready to weather a gut punch. Steep and narrow
      streets are not salted and seldom plowed. Residents write off travel on the day or so following the snowfall and wait
      for winter's rains to melt away hazards, allowing normal life to resume.

      On a walk through north Capitol Hill this morning, one resident noted fellow Seattlites reacting to the day's novelty.
      Two children, draped in thick overcoats, ran for a bus with their father under an umbrella that he held overhead.
      "Are you okay?", he asked, as if this snow weren't a few degrees Fahrenheit from the cold rain these kids must know well.
      Another man led his poodle down the sidewalk, it like a lady avoiding puddles, perhaps wishing to have back
      the fur that had been groomed from its legs. Such is the way in this city, where bare legs may only come to bite
      you once per year.

      By afternoon, the temperature ambled over the freezing point and total accumulation was nil. Snow continued
      to spit from the grey sky, but it seemed this would be no White Christmas. The city ground on, cars zipped up
      the steep avenues of Capitol Hill, and as the sun set on the winter afternoon the flurries amounted to only a talking point.
