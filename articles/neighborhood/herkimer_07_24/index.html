        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

      I stopped by Herkimer Coffee on a recent Sunday, bent on doing that kind of weekend make-work that won't induce sweat, won't remind one of their day job, but might still bring productivity's relief. Along with my laptop, a notebook, and a book book, I brought a friend. We'd walked the hills of Greenwood, burning the morning hours as we chatted about this and that. Then, wanting for a cafe, we crested the hills onto Greenwood Ave and walked a few blocks before we found Herkimer.

      	There are three Herkimers around the city. They are serious about their coffee, which they offer in wholesale and retail quantities. According to their website's FAQ section, people frequently ask them: "What are your roast profiles?" Apparently not frequently asked: "What is a roast profile?" We found the long sitting room busy with folks both working and not - much more social than a cafe on a weekday. Elbow room <b>Lacking</b>, we quickly grabbed a two seater in the back near the restrooms. Behind the bar, lightly tattooed baristas in tank tops caught up with one another, occasionally taking orders. Velvet Underground played on the speakers (<b>Headphones Out</b> here) and the walls held spooky paintings of contorted bodies.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      When we got to the front of the line, the baristas weren't finished with their conversation. One had seen Emily Nenni at the Tractor Tavern the night before. Another stayed late at Chop Suey, stating that she was finally over that stage of her life. After a minute, they took our order - a drip coffee, lavender latte, and chocolate chip cookie - but it seemed they wanted me to know they had more important things to do. Oh well. They looked cool and I understood - they were <b>Pleasantly Not Warm</b>. Their attitude, the <b>Slothful</b> wifi, and the melancholy music combined for a challenging environment. Perhaps Herkimer's management feared that if we became comfortable, we'd become complacent. We would not notice their interesting roast profiles. I get it. The atmosphere here was <b>Pleasantly Not Warm</b>.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      We took our coffee and cookie back to the table and sat among the <b>Youthful Hip</b> clientele. Next to us, a twee couple in their thirties budgeted. A woman in a red beanie, sweatshirt, and camo pants ate a croissant. Both the drip and the latte were <b>Pleasant</b>; the cookie <b>Pleasant</b>, too. Intentionally or not, the baristas had achieved something of quality, and my friend and I began to settle in.

      But, then, what about the paintings? Nude forms, black and white, reached from the grave, arms twisting like thick vines in search of sun.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "The one above you looks upset," I said.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      My friend looked over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I don't have any reason to fear her."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I scanned the other paintings. Many of their subjects silently screamed as Herkimer's patrons made small talk below them. I felt they were desperate to break out from their plane and touch somebody.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Do you think they're worth $700?" I asked after seeing a price tag.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      My friend looked up from her laptop, brow raised, then checked the paintings once more.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      "Maybe that one with the nice tits."
