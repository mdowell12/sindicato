        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

      Vagabond Cafe is a hipster den in Taipei's Shilin District, just off the MRT red line. I visited on a late morning in December following a rumor that they pour a fine cup. The cafe is in one of the short buildings that line the brick walkway under the train, which runs elevated through Shilin. Its floor-to-ceiling front windows, the only avenue for natural light in the space, are tinted, suggesting the folks inside aren't hungry for sunshine. At a two-seater next to me, a young man in a black overcoat did nothing to dispel that notion. He wore grey slacks, patent leather shoes, one earring, earbuds. In his tattooed hand, he held a small notebook whose unlined pages were filled with crisp handwriting. Possibly some collection of incantations. (Clientele: <b>Youthful Hip</b>).
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        The space was cluttered. A large wardrobe sat along the wall opposite the seating area. A bookshelf sat in front of it. And in front of that there was a pink kids bike with training wheels. Decoration or just detritus?
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The two female baristas wore all black. They stood quietly behind a small counter in the back of the room. When I ordered a pourover and a cookie, they gave me a look that made me wonder if I'd bothered them (Staff Congeniality: <b>Not Kind</b>). Soon after I returned to my seat, they joined the man in the black overcoat for a smoke out front. My coffee would have to wait. No problem - it gave me a little time to think.

      Traveling alone has its tradeoffs. Without the company and planning capacity of another, the traveler must find their own entertainment. They shoulder the entire burden of the various chores of travel: booking the right accommodations, finding a viable route between destinations, hunting for good food and drink. But on the other side of the coin, they're beholden to no other person's wants or needs. They are without the boon of commiseration when headwinds hit, but they earn a stronger pride when they push through and find something joyful - a jewel in their memory crown all the more special because it is their own.

    <p class="text">
      It's easier to make plans on the fly by oneself. There is the chance to match, in real time, what one is doing with how one feels.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Such a solo traveler might think of themselves as a "leaf in the breeze". Dropped into a novel setting - a new city, a foreign country, a region on the globe - with no obligations, they surrender their decision making to forces of the environment. They look ahead one intersection at a time, choosing the direction with the vibrant storefronts, the interesting alleyway, or the laughing voices. When they finish with one city, they pick the next based on something they read today in a magazine. They book a room for tomorrow after a quick scan of prices and reviews on Airbnb.
    </p>

      This can be exciting, especially when it bears ripe fruit. A long time ago, I traveled alone through Spain, working south from Madrid. One morning at a hostel in Grenada, I discussed plans to take a train to Malaga that day, where I'd enjoy the beaches on Spain's Mediterranean coast. But a woman across the table said I should go to Cadiz instead, on the Atlantic coast, where the town was quaint and the beaches less resort-y. So that's what I did. Two days later, I ferried across the Strait of Gibraltar to Tangier, Morocco, and made new friends at a hostel. They planned to take a bus to Chefchaouen, a mountain town a few hours away. The whole town square was painted baby blue from ground to roof. I'd never heard of it, but I went with them anyway. Everything just worked.

      Back at Vagabond, two women in their 20s, dressed to the nines, took photos of each other as they pretended to sip their drinks. The barista brought my coffee and cookie. Soft rock played on the speakers, energizing the space without interrupting (<b>Headphones Out</b>). The coffee came in a nice porcelain cup and it was delicately flavored, fitting the vessel. Almost like an earl grey tea and the best I'd had in weeks (Quality of Beverage: <b>Superlative</b>). The cookie, unfortunately, was too thin (Quality of Victuals: <b>Disappoint</b>). I'd ordered it from a jar next to the cash register that may not have seen much use. The snacks here are an afterthought.

      The going isn't always easy as it was on my trip through Spain. There are fallow places and times out there and to go without a plan is to risk drifting into them. Already in Asia on a longer trip, I'd decided to visit Taiwan a week before arriving there. I booked flights into and out of Taipei with a vague hope to spend time in the country's mountains, or along its coast, or both. I'd seen a picture of a rocky beach surrounded by verdant cliffs that dropped straight into the ocean and figured, if I could just go to that place, I'd be all set.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I didn't know exactly where the picture was taken but from what I'd heard, Taiwan's east side would have what I was looking for. It's known for its steep canyons and large mountains that butt right up against the Pacific. But much of the area has been closed since a major earthquake destabilized the land in April 2024. Two friends who visited Taiwan in recent months avoided the area because nothing was open.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Lucky for me, I'd heard a rumor that Taroko National Park, the most renowned of all the beautiful settings on Taiwan's east coast, had just reopened. A quick search on the internet confirmed. So, with a day's notice, I booked three nights in Hualien, the town closest to the park.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      The next day, after a three hour train ride, I was in the town, checking into an Airbnb. But something was off. I'd walked from the station past two scooter rental shops, both closed and with their full fleet of scooters sitting out front. Two people passed me on the street and eyed me curiously. My apartment was on the second floor of an austere high rise - a sufficient but not comfortable room. And my host, extremely kind but with a telling note of sympathy, began telling me about the free shuttle buses running for tourists.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I thought I'd just go to the national park," I said.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "But it's closed," she replied with a grimace. "That's why they're running the buses to other tourist sites."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "I heard it just reopened!"
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Hmm, I can check."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I got back on my phone and she walked to a nearby info center. When we reconvened, she confirmed what I'd figured out: the west side of the park, only accessible from the other side of the island, had reopened. The eastside remained closed. Slowly, I came to understand the consequences of the rash decision I'd made to come here. I'd landed in a place that simply wasn't happening.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "Maybe I'll just check out the city," I said to my host.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      "There's nothing for you here," she replied.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      That night, I explored what I could on a rusty bike my host lent me. The next day, I rode the shuttle to the national park entrance. It was at the mouth of Taroko Gorge and was as far into the mountains as they'd let me go. I walked around the empty-feeling visitors center reading every word on the informational displays, squeezing every ounce of juice from this orange.

    <p class="text">
      Then I began walking toward the ocean. I walked along a quiet road above the Liwu River and its boulder-strewn wash, a half mile wide. It was a mile to the town on the coast. I thought I might grab lunch, but the town, a string of buildings along the coastal highway, didn't have much. There was a gas station, a convenience store. A few stores had shelves off the street with jars of pickled chili and other knick knacks, but I saw no one around to buy or sell them. I kept walking down broken sidewalks along the busy highway.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Past the town, the sidewalk ended and there was only the highway. It was two lanes here and cut through the jungle below a steep, muddy cliff. I pressed on, stepping off the road when cars and dump trucks whizzed past. In a moment between cars, I thought I heard a loud bird call, then a branch snap. I looked into the trees across the road and saw a grey monkey with a red face - a Formosan rock macaque - looking back. It crawled to another branch and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p/>

    </figure>

    <p class="text">
      Finally, I found the gravel road toward the beach that I'd been aiming for. Nobody here either. Just an empty building with a few broken windows, a piece of excavating equipment, and a shack full of rentable kayaks. I passed through a short tunnel under the railroad tracks and stepped onto the beach.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <figure class="article-img">
      <img class="article-img" src="./img/beach-south-resized.jpeg"/>
    </figure>

    <p class="text">
      The beach stretched far to the south, curving seaward where a bonfire burned. In the distance to the north, a stunning mountain plunged thousands of feet straight into the sea. I was alone there. I continued north, picking lanes through loose, seaworn rock. When the sun broke through the clouds, the water shifted from a heavy blue to a lighthearted cerulean, mocking me. Brutish waves, ten feet tall, broke directly on the beach.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I walked and walked toward the mountain, but it didn't seem to get closer. When I decided I'd walked far enough, I took a seat on a salt-soaked tree trunk. I dug in my pack for a makeshift lunch: chocolate-covered espresso beans, assorted nuts, and water.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I was a two mile walk and a twenty mile bus ride from Hualien. Other than the trains on the hillside and some noise from the highway, it was easy to imagine all other people were far behind me. As if the end of the beach ahead - where the imposing mountain cut it off and the boundless sea took over - might be the end of the map and I was the northernmost person alive. The exposed tip of an arrow. Or maybe the butt end. I had everything I needed at that moment - food, water, comfortable temperatures, and a humbling view. Essentially the same view from the photo that'd inspired me to come here. But I felt a bit out of place.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Revisiting the "leaf in the breeze" simile: maybe a better strategy is to be a river raft pilot with a hand on the tiller. The pilot uses the river's forces to their advantage rather than simply surrendering to them. The river's current still rules, but the deft pilot keeps the raft moving within it, out of the eddies, away from hazards. There is a bit of intentionality.

    <p class="text">
      Indeed my best days on the trip began with a hint of a plan. I'd check the map and pick one or two anchor points for the day: a pretty green space in Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh's mausoleum in Hanoi, a brunch spot in Taipei. Maybe I'd ride a taxi or train to the place, check it out, then start walking. I'd pick a general heading toward another interesting spot. Then I'd see what came up along the way and stop when I felt like it. When I found something that resonated with me - delicious or surprising food, a comfortable place to sit and watch the city - those things stuck in my memory. They were small treasures that I carried with me to Vagabond and beyond.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Vagabond itself was one such gem on a day with many of them. The anchor points: the National Palace Museum around noon and dinner with a friend in the evening. A bit of scaffold under which serendipity had room to work. Shilin was on the way to the museum and happened to be home to a few cafes I wanted to visit. I bussed there and started walking around the neighborhood. I bought two sandwiches to pack away for lunch - one pork floss, one blueberry jam with cheese. Then I came to Vagabond, where the WiFi was <b>Snappy</b>, elbow room was <b>Present</b>, and the atmosphere was <b>Warm</b>. I felt like I was competently navigating Taipei and I was having fun.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      A lady on the bus to Shilin had smiled at me when I got on. She giggled a bit with her friends and I started to suspect I was being admired. She and her friends got off the bus, the door closed, then she turned around, looked at me. With a big smile, she yelled "bye bye!".
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Sometimes the universe does provide. But also, I'd put on a nice shirt that morning. I'll take a little credit for making my own luck. Just the right amount of touch on the tiller.
