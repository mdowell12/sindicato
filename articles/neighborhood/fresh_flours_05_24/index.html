        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

      Fresh Flours is a local Japanese-inspired bakery with four cafes around the city. Totally unaware of its cultural lean, I paid a visit to their Phinney Ridge location. The shop occupies a corner of 61st Street and Phinney Avenue, anchoring a modern brick mixed-use development. Though Phinney Avenue is a wide and busy street, the cafe has a neighborhood feel, with a decidedly <b>Stay-at-home Parental</b> clientele. Strollers abound. As I waited in line, I surveyed an impressive array of pastries, though I found no indication of the Japanese inspiration behind them. A handful of middle aged men worked behind the counter. They were dressed in that Seattle way that suggests they were "men who work", but is a bit too cultivated to be believable. While they were respectful, they were not warm; I give Fresh Flours a <b>Kind</b> rating for Staff Congeniality.

      	I ordered a drip coffee and added cream. Still, when I got around to sipping it, pleasant fruity notes crept through. From the selection of pastries, I chose an onion and swiss croissant, which the staff warmed. I counted it above average. Quality of Beverage: <b>Pleasant</b>. Quality of Victuals: <b>Pleasant</b>.

      A space with tables sits around the corner from the service counter, and there is <b>Present</b> Elbow Room here. I found a two-seater and pulled out my computer. Behind me, two mothers joined tables for their three children. To my side, a father and his teenage daughter chatted. On the speakers, a bluegrass cover of a Beyonce song. Corny. This is a <b>Headphones In</b> environment.

    <p class="text">
      A few of the nearby tables were littered with crumpled napkins and dirty mugs, the chairs remaining where recent occupants haphazardly left them. The children behind me fought over a blueberry danish. It was a cold, wet day outside, and I felt more like I worked from a cafeteria than in a coffee shop. Atmosphere: <b>Not Warm</b>.

    <p class="text">
      And yet, the WiFi was <b>Snappy</b>, I had a fine drink in hand, a savory snack, and little to complain of. As I checked messages from work, the father and daughter laughed about something. They sat across from each other, huddled over their pastries like they conspired something secret.

      "Your mother was never a comfortable traveler", the dad said.

      "Why not?"

    <p class="text">
      "I don't know." He pulled a piece from his croissant and chewed on it.

      "Didn't you two go on trips all the time when you were young?"

      "Yes. You know, we spent two weeks in Thailand before you were born. We saved for a year and she was so excited for it. Well, you know how early she wakes up. For the first week of the trip, every morning, she would leave our room and ask the hotel staff to figure out the price of the next flight to Seattle. One of the concierges asked me about it one day. They'd find the price for her, and I guess she'd consider blowing up the trip for a minute. Then she'd decide to stay another day and she'd come back to bed. I think once she got past that daily crisis, she could relax."

      The daughter pursed her lips, considering. "Sometimes getting started is the hard part."
