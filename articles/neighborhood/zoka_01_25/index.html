        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

        I spent a recent afternoon at Zoka Coffee in the U District. It was a rainy Saturday and UW undergrads held down most of the tables in the long, wood-adorned seating area. Sweatpants, JanSports, oversized iced beverages, notebooks, laptops, highlighters. This was classic <b>Gen Z Grease</b> clientele.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        I took my drip coffee and chocolate chip cookie to a small table by the front windows. When I connected my laptop to the WiFi, Zoka's site tried to sign me up for an email distribution. I remembered then that the barista asked me if I was part of their online loyalty program. Quite the overhead for a local cafe, but not for a burgeoning enterprise. This must be a chain, I thought. 
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        Indeed, Zoka has four locations, all in the Seattle area. The first opened in 1997. According to their website: "The hope was to positively impact [the] community with truly fresh roasted coffee, talented baristas and a welcoming atmosphere." Zoka, in Japanese, means the beginning of something (at least the owner said that in a newspaper article back then). I wondered how Zoka had changed in the last 27 years since that hopeful beginning.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        You may guess that I, foremost surveyor of remote work-friendly cafes with a hound's nose for quality, am skeptical of chains. You'd be correct. But a number of the cafes reviewed thus far in this column are chains, if only three or so locations long, and some have scored well. Being part of a chain doesn't mean a cafe can't be a nice place to grab a cup and get work done.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        Why the skepticism, then? It's because when businesses scale, they can lose touch with the humanity that made them special in the first place. I didn't connect with the barista at Zoka on this day (Staff Congeniality: <b>Not Kind</b>). The gas fireplace at the end of the sitting area felt ornamental, not an effective corner piece of the environment (Atmosphere: <b>Not Warm</b>). Had this chain strayed from its inciting spirit?
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        <a href="https://www.zokacoffee.com/pages/our-story">A video on Zoka's website</a>, made for their 25th anniversary, tells us a bit about the business in its current stage. The Lead Barista, describing the pour over process, mentions the word "consistency" multiple times. The Founder and CEO, making a cup in a back room, says, "If [you] stick to an equation, just like with a scientific study, you know, you have to follow the formulas and you have to be the same every time to get the same results." To grow a business, you must learn to repeat what you're good at. You must teach others how to repeat it. They must repeat it across locations. A process is born.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        Another quote from the website, notably different from what the owner said in the article two decades ago: "The term Zoka means rebirth of the coffee tree in Colombia. After a thorough pruning, the tree will rebirth into a highly productive tree again." A scaling business, too, may need pruned, streamlined, before it is reborn as something more productive.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        Prune enough times and you might end up with a tree that's extraordinarily productive, stretching far from its roots. Two middle aged couples sat at the large wooden table in the middle of the shop. One of the men went on about a local company that's grown abnormally large.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        "The wages don't change and their profits just keep soaring," he said. "You can tip the person who delivers your groceries. There's an option for it. The money doesn't go to them, though."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        "It doesn't go to them?", said the man across the table.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        "No, Amazon says it goes toward increasing their wages, or something like that. But they aren't getting it. People are out there struggling to survive."
    </p>
    <p/>

        Zoka is not Amazon, of course. The video on their site spends its latter half talking about care for craft and community. A customer makes a nod to the "art of the roaster", who must trust their skill to roast the perfect Zoka bean. Then, the Zoka's Lead Roaster defers credit to those who grew the bean. The CEO, on the farmers: "They haven't lost their soul...They're working hard on making spectacular coffee, and they're dedicating their life to it." 
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        The Director of Retail says, "It's a really small community feel, but you know that everyone genuinely cares about each other, and that's important to me. There's a lot of integrity behind the people that work at Zoka."
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        Is this all just marketing material for a corporation that knows it's left something behind? Certainly, large businesses know they can decorate themselves in the accoutrement of authenticity to distract from their lack of it. But I think Zoka is trying to stay true. Again, in the video, the CEO says, "I just want to serve great coffee, and have friends come in, and have it be a really cool part of the world." I believe it. But I also wonder if you need a Director of Retail to achieve that.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        In the end, businesses that grow do so because they are able to focus on and fill some niche. Amazon sells goods to us as cheaply and conveniently as possible. Zoka serves good coffee in a place where folks can gather away from home: I found both the Quality of Beverage and of Victuals <b>Pleasant</b>. They kept the music low and I kept my <b>Headphones Out</b>, mostly to eavesdrop on my neighbors. Not quite community, but better than working at home alone. And, despite a <b>Slothful</b> WiFi connection, Elbow Room was <b>Present</b> enough for me to feel comfortable and get some work done. Zoka did their job. I just know there's something more that might maybe come from less.
