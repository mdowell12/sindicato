    <h1>Costco Run</h1>
    <h2>April 3, 2023</h2>
    <p class="text">
      On a recent Thursday afternoon, Seattlites flocked to the Costco in SODO. Costco is not only a members-exclusive bulk retail chain,
      but also the world's foremost purveyor of rotisserie chicken. The store's first warehouse, opened in 1983, stood on the grounds of
      this modern SODO location. It sits in the industrial heart of Seattle, nestled between a band of railroad tracks and the four lanes
      of 4th Avenue.

      Were the Seattlites aware of this land's hallowed place in the history of American consumerism? Likely not, for the Costco experience
      does not leave space for contemplation. These folks were on a "Costco run", a gauntlet run, a Death Star Trench Run. Safety is not
      guaranteed within the warehouse confines. Like overladen cargo ships, shopping carts float lethargically through the merchandise.
      Their pilots must chart their course three steps in advance. Speed may be slow, but collisions of such mass have catastrophic potential.

    <p class="text">
      Consider one Seattlite who traversed the canned beverage aisle. An impatient shopper tailgated him as he passed various sodas and seltzers.
      Trapped in this cart parade, he dared not slow down to check sugar contents. Not with two hundred pounds of steel and bulk goods nipping at
      his heels. The purchasing decision was reduced to grab-or-not-grab as he floated down the shelves. This was perhaps part of Costco's business strategy.

    <p class="text">
      Another shopper found herself rooted in anxiety as she tried to exit the shelves and enter the chaos of the inter-aisle area. She used maximum thrust to
      reach highway speeds and integrate with the cart flow. As children skirted through the traffic like electrons in Brownian motion,
      she worried that her Chevy Suburban of a cart might hit and maim one of them. But there was not much to do. One must move with the herd on
      the Costco paths, lest they risk their own life and limb. Besides, let's face it: these would not be the first or the last children lost under
      the wheels of the machine.

    <p class="text">
      Yet, amid all the mayhem, two elderly women near the peanut butter parked their carts smack in the middle of the aisle. They stood slack-jawed,
      staring at the shelves. Like a stubborn boulder in a mountain stream, they forced the flow to move around them.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
	    "I worked with a woman once who ate peanut butter and jelly every single day", one said.
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
	    "You're kidding me".
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
	    "Every. Single. Day."
    </p>
    <p/>
    <p class="text">
	    Was this not art? Might these women be actors planted within a grand performance? The warehouse seemed to send up a particular strand
      of American capitalism. Things took up space here without apology. The deals were nectar to the hive, who valued convenience and low
      prices over individualism. Quaint delicacies like "buy local" were crushed under the monster truck tires of this establishment.
      To shop here was not to make love - it was plainly and simply to get a job done.

      For the shopping Seattlites, the trip, if not the purchasing, ended across the threshold of the checkout aisle. Here, survivors of the
      Costco run collected themselves. Many rested on the picnic tables at the food court, watching as white-coated chefs prepared hot dogs
      and pizza by pulling levers and pressing buttons. Refueled and restocked, the shoppers sauntered to the parking lot. They pushed their
      carts now with the weary calm of marathon runners who had finally finished and caught their breath. And finally, they returned home with
      their haul, safe again until it all had been consumed.
