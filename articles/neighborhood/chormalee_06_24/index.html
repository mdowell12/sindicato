        When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a person to find a way to occupy their time, particularly those hours Monday to Friday nine to five, they might find an Occupation. Absent that, maybe a Charitable Cause. Or perhaps they'll create heartfelt Art. Short of all that, they might simply pass the time. And they might as well get paid while it passes, so they get a desk job. And if they still aren't entertained, they begin rating coffee shops: the outsourced office space of so many itinerant internet workers, the home away from home for those who work from home.

        In this series, I visit the region's cafes and rate their suitability for remote work. With my keen senses and a unique set of heuristics, I attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff, to surface those true gems, where the bored working hours of the computer-bound just might pass with pleasure.

      Chormalee Coffee is a charming open air cafe in Phra Padaeng, on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand. On a Wednesday in late November, I had lunch there under a tree that shaded the entire space. It was pad thai and buttermilk roti with glaze (<b>Pleasant</b>), plus an orange americano (<b>Pleasant</b>). What's an orange americano? It's a shot of espresso and orange juice over ice, of course. A strange beverage from a foreign land. Maybe unappealing to an American-o. But as with all such things, context is key.

        Bangkok is hot - temperatures stay above 90 F year round - and the city moves hard. 
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Traffic is constant background noise. Scooter and tuk tuk engines drone on at a pitch somewhere between weed eater and motorcycle. At the big intersections, streams of cars flow across each other like sludge, while two-wheelers dart through momentary gaps. 
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      It's thrilling to watch. To cross a street feels dangerous, at least to a newcomer like me. On my first night, I stood streetside, clutched my bag, and waited minutes for a break in traffic that never came. Finally, I stepped out into it. I kept a constant and timid pace as I crossed, hoping that if I behaved predictably, everyone else would adjust. The scooter drivers zipped around me, parting as naturally as water around a rock in a stream. No surprise, I made it across just fine, now with a small sense that I'd gotten up to the city's speed.

    <p class="text">
      Phra Pradaeng is called Bangkok's "green lung". A lobe-like peninsula within one of the Chao Phraya River's bends, it's been set aside by the government to remain mostly-green space. It's a flat, sleepy, tree-covered neighborhood with roads that often narrow to a car's width. Driving through the jungle-like veg, one feels they're returning from the beach in rural Hawaii, not on an urban excursion minutes outside one of Earth's biggest cities.
    </p>
    <p/>
  
    <p class="text">
      I'd taxied to Sri Nakhon Khuean Khan Park and Botanical Garden in the middle of the district that morning, then paid $1.50 to rent a bike. I cycled around the park, reading about their ecological restoration projects, listening to the birds, enjoying respite from Bangkok's perpetual and frenetic motion. Then I biked to the cafe.

    <p class="text">
      I'll admit, though this column is a popular Review of Cafes Through the Lense of The Remote Worker, I hadn't come to Phra Pradaeng and Chormalee Coffee to get anything done. In fact, I was on a break from work. No laptop with me that day, just traveling: car, bike, foot, boat, foot, train, foot. Seeing what I saw. A cafe on a day like this is a pit stop. You refuel and reorient. You rest your feet. You look at the map and find the next place to go.

    <p class="text">
      When I stepped through the gate into the garden at Chormalee, a short older lady in charge pointed me to a seat. She brought out an English version of the menu, a notepad and pen, and told me to write down what I wanted. "We have pad thai", she said, smiling. (Staff Congeniality: <b>Kind</b>, Staff Subtlety: Not).
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
        She left and I took a look around. There was a single room kitchen with a fridge and sink, plus an outdoor cooking area along the wall by the road. Groups of friends, mostly past retirement age, ate lunch under the covered verandas that bordered the garden (Clientele: <b>Joyful Geezer</b>). One crew brought and sipped from their own case of Chang beer. Covers of 70s American folk played softly from a radio in the kitchen ("Heart of Gold", "It Never Rains in California", Chicago's "If You Leave Me Now"). I kept my <b>Headphones Out</b>, opened my book, and settled in like everyone else had (Atmosphere: <b>Warm</b>, Elbow Room: <b>Present</b>).
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Over the next two hours, I ate my lunch and read, cooling down under the big tree. At some point, the radio switched to 50s ballads ("Unchained Melody", "Put Your Head on My Shoulder"). Sort of saccharine. Just like my orange americano with all the added sugar that'd raise my hackles back home. But not here, where the oppressive heat needed to be cut by something sweet. Not here, on vacation.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      I was so thrilled. I wanted to walk across the entire city, then do it again in another direction. I wanted to turn over every stone, peek around every corner, to talk to people, to know what happened that made the country like this and what would happen next and thereafter. Isn't that what falling in love is? To become endlessly interested?

      Put it in contrast with a note I'd written to myself a month before, back in Seattle:
    </p>
    <p/>

    <em>
      <p class="text">
        Had some experiences lately where I've felt like I was just auto-piloting through one scheduled thing after another. Even things I did for fun, like a day of rock climbing. "Just gotta get through today" sort of stuff. Whatever it is I hoped to get out of those activities, I wasn't. Whatever I felt like I needed to be doing instead, I wasn't. Sometimes I don't feel like I deserve the amount of leisure time that I take.
      </p>
      <p/>
    </em>

    <p class="text">
      Oh my god, fucking yawn.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Day-to-day me is so watchful of being duped, or of getting a bad deal. Why try a new restaurant in Seattle when so many of them have been just-okay-and-also-$40? But on this day, my first in Bangkok, I said dupe me. Everything - even the aisles of a supermarket - was new and rich. I just wanted to participate. Even getting duped would be interesting. It helped that everything was cheap and at worst I'd be out a few dollars.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      Back to that word, saccharine. At home I'd use that term with vitriol. All the time in normal life, I make myself think long term. I don't indulge. I am disciplined so that I stay strong, sharp, safe. I make progress, or at least I'm always striving to. So the sweet bits are saved for occasional treats. Don't enjoy too much or you might grow a soft belly, mind, or heart.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      But on the patio at Chormalee, on the first day of a five week vacation, I was cashing in. I didn't check added sugar levels. I reveled. I felt excited, content, in love, interested.
    </p>
    <p/>

    <p class="text">
      How long could it last? Sober me thought: not forever. Sober me feared the come down, too. But I shut that person out. Sometimes they are a total drag, I thought. I love them, but today I am not interested in them.
